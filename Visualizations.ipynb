And as we said to those on our email list: These are tough times for those who love the American pursuit of ever greater equality. But in Republicans’ Lance Armstronging their response to all the charges they and their Supreme Court candidate are facing, it is clear their dance is coming to an end. When the facts are on your side, argue the facts. When the law is on your side, argue the law. When neither is on your side, bang your shoe on the table. From witnessing the events of this past week, this group is going to be in need of a good cobbler very soon. For Penzeys most popular Cobbler Recipe click here: https://www.penzeys.com/…/recipes/spiced-blackberry-cobbler/ Please sign up for our email list by clicking here:  http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html The thing about flat-out denying reality is that there’s no stepping back from it. There’s no negotiation afterwards that arrives at some mutually agreeable spot. Once you choose the Lance Armstrong approach, once you choose to attack those just doing their job by exposing your crimes, you’ve started a timer that, when it goes DING, means you are done. To go the full Lance is to understand that all there is ahead for you is lifetime suspension.  The leaders of the Republican Party are now on an end-of-days run. All there is left for them is to do as much damage as they can, to the benefit of their benefactors, before time runs out. November 6th is coming soon. Remember.  And in fairness to Mr. Armstrong, as much as he cheated and destroyed lives, he also tried to do some good. Not so much with the privileged guys we’ve seen this past week.  Thanks for being Cooks. You bring hope to the world, Bill Penzey bill@penzeys.com Thanks again.

      "Saint Louis Pet Expo friends - We have tried unsuccessfully for two days now to get the RFT and the author of this story to correct multiple inaccuracies. For reasons that we do not understand, this has not happened. For starters, the Pet Expo is not cancelled. There was also never a check given to the Arena that was returned insufficient. This is all outlined in the lawsuit we filed against the Arena seven months ago. We asked the author if he has read the suit and he had no...t at the time of publication. It appears that is still the case. Additionally, we did not cancel last year’s event. It was cancelled on is with less than a week’s notice, and we were denied a right to cure and other rights granted by our contract. We were never given a firm reason for the cancellation and we only learned of it on social media. Our deposit was also kept by the facility. Any allegations of fraud were made over 16 months ago and have been proven false. Yet this is still brought up. We have held every scheduled show in 2018, and despite the cute headline in this story, Saint Louis will go on as well. Please visit www.StlPetExpo.com for details. Because all of this started by the actions of our former CPA, whose hatred of our LGBTQ employees led her to sabotage our business and cause incredible financial losses for both us and our exhibitors, we find the fact that RFT display such extreme bias against our company very odd. We also question the nature of the relationship the RFT has with the BBB that they would reprint nearly wholesale the release sent by the BBB, which itself was completely inaccurate.

      "Just the other day I had the opportunity to visit the headquarters of the Central Islip-Hauppauge Volunteer Ambulance Corps located at 4 Pineville Road in Central Islip. A few weeks ago Paul Ryan and Matthew Pasieka of the Ambulance Corps met with me in my district office to discuss the construction project underway at their headquarters. This outstanding organization is a vital part of the communities they serve, answering more than 7,000 calls a year. Because of the dramati...c increase in opioid use, the Ambulance Corps' service and expertise are more indispensable than ever. Additionally, of course, Central Islip has had to confront the murderous brutality of MS-13. During that initial meeting Paul and Matthew had asked me to visit the Ambulance Corps headquarters and meet with some of their members - - both volunteer and paid. I was glad to take them up on it. The members I met and spoke with were extremely dedicated and concerned for the community. They do a terrific job and It is obvious why they are so necessary.

      "I'm grateful to Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Jenny McCarthy, Mark Blaxill, Dr. Paul Thomas, Dr. Chris Exley, and Jennifer Margulis, Ph.D., all of whom have provided reviews of my book (included below). The book remains at #1 in the Autism/Asperger's category, because of the choice of so many of you to pre-order the book, which will be released on September 19th. Thank YOU for your support, and if you haven't pre-ordered, I hope you consider doing so.  “J.B. Handley is arguably the... world’s most thoughtful, sophisticated, knowledgeable, and indefatigable activist for children’s health and safety. As a frontline leader for fifteen years, Handley has led the big fistfight against the Pharma Cartel to force the issue, broadcast the science, and expose the lies behind the vaccine policies that have created an epidemic of chronic disease among our children. Handley has helped bring the issue of toxins in medical products and regulatory corruption to a tipping point. Handley’s advocacy has lifted the curtain of lies behind which the autism epidemic has sprouted. When we end this cataclysm, it will be thanks to the dogged character of people like J.B. Handley who have refused to rest in his battle to support parents, protect children, bring justice to injured families, and to punish those responsible for one of the worst scandals in American history. Please read this book and decide for yourself if you still believe that vaccines are ‘safe and effective.’” ―Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. “I honestly believe J.B. Handley wrote the book that will end the autism epidemic. As I sit here now, in stillness, I want to jump up and down with excitement, but I’m holding back rivers of tears. He breaks down the scientific information in a way that doesn’t intimidate the reader. And he lets us know it’s okay to be angry. His soul, his fight, his love for his son radiates off the pages. Wow. Bravo, bravo.” ―Jenny McCarthy, author of Louder Than Words; coauthor of Healing and Preventing Autism  \"This book is inspired, powerful, the unadulterated truth, and a must read. We have sacrificed too many children at the vaccine altar while our blind belief in the CDC and AAP, government, and the media has prevented us from seeing the conflicts of interest that enable big business and Big Pharma to profit at the expense of our children’s health. How to End the Autism Epidemic is one family’s story, but it is sadly also a story shared by millions of families. A beautiful normal baby, vaccinated, and then lost to autism and all the horrible medical conditions associated with immune devastation and brain toxicity. Thank you, J.B., for sharing your story and wisdom. Parents and future parents: Read this book now, and say No to business as usual and the status quo. If your pediatrician has not yet done his or her own research and is just parroting the ‘vaccines are safe and effective’ marketing phrase, it is time for you to get a new pediatrician.” ―Paul Thomas, MD, coauthor of The Vaccine-Friendly Plan and The Addiction Spectrum “As parents our job is to be concerned about our children’s health. Yet every day in doctors’ offices around the country, American parents are told we are being ‘irresponsible’ or ‘selfish’ just for asking questions about vaccines. We all want to keep our children safe and healthy, both from infectious diseases and from overexposure to toxins. It’s reasonable to be concerned that there are too many vaccines on the schedule and that medications like antibiotics, acetaminophen, and ADHD drugs are being over-prescribed. What’s a worried parent to do? For starters, read this book! Sharing his personal story as the father of a boy with autism and taking a close look at the most recent and rigorous science, Stanford-educated J.B. Handley shows how the CDC’s aggressive childhood vaccine schedule is connected to the astonishing rise in autism in the United States. How to End the Autism Epidemic is a direct challenge to the American public health establishment and a gift to the millions of parents who find themselves caught in the crosshairs―uncertain of what to think or do―of the seemingly intractable debate about vaccines.” ―Jennifer Margulis, PhD, author of Your Baby, Your Way; coauthor of The Vaccine-Friendly Plan “I have been thinking about the toxicity of aluminum for thirty-five years. It is my life’s work. Before we completed our recent research on aluminum in brain tissue in autism, I could not see a direct link between human exposure to aluminum and autism. I certainly saw no immediate role for aluminum adjuvants in vaccines in autism. The missing link was a mechanism whereby the brain would be subjected to an acute exposure to aluminum, for example, as occurs in aluminum-induced dialysis encephalopathy. Pro-inflammatory cells, some originating from blood and lymph, heavily loaded with a cargo of aluminum in brain tissue in autism provided that missing link. We all tolerate the toxicity of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines. Unfortunately, some of us are predisposed to suffer, as opposed to tolerate, the toxicity of aluminum adjuvants, and this may cause autism. Autism is a disease, and it is not inevitable. J.B. Handley’s elegant synthesis of what we know and what we need to know argues that autism could and should be preventable. I agree with him.” ―Professor Christopher Exley, PhD, fellow, Royal Society of Biology; professor of bioinorganic chemistry, Keele University “J.B. Handley tells it like it is. His new book is a masterful synthesis of all the latest threads of autism: the controversies, the science, the legal and policy battles, and the human dimension of the ‘movement’ that has inspired so many of us to become parent activists. Peppered with jaw-dropping new developments―including depositions from major vaccine science luminaries―Handley weaves a compelling narrative and cuts through the noise to make a powerful and convincing case. Read it. Process what he’s telling you. And then stand up and do something about it. The health of generations of children is at stake.” ―Mark Blaxill, coauthor of The Age of Autism, Vaccines, 2.0, and Denial #defeatautismnow #cureautismnow #endautismnow #myautism #berniewasright #readthebook #theautismbook https://www.amazon.com/How-Autism-Epidemic-J-B…/…/1603588248\n",

      "Now more than ever, Kindness can’t sit down simply because anger has stood up. — Last week in the US Senate’s Supreme Court hearing anger stood up in a big way. How we respond to this anger will go a long way towards defining who we are as a people and what we become as a nation. As Cooks know, Kindness is our greatest strength. Now is the time to use this strength to the advantage of all.  To the President, and to his supporters in congress and on the Supreme Court, anger is... not an honest emotion, anger is a tool. For too long we’ve allowed them to use their less than sincere anger and rage to cause us to step back. Not any more. They want their shouts, and the shouts of their backers, to make us feel uncertain and depressed about what is going on in our country. As depressing as they are, there is no uncertainty that the majority of Americans don’t support their using the Supreme Court to take rights away from women. This isn’t happening on our watch.  At the heart of cooking is the belief that when we give of ourselves to help others, the world becomes a better place. Through cooking we’ve come to understand the strength of kindness really can heal the world. The next great moment for kindness comes 11.6.18 on Election Day. Make your plan to vote, but please give thought to encouraging others to vote, too. You are a Cook, people look up to you. Your encouragement means everything. Let them know how important this election is. Help them put together the ingredients they need for a healthy and satisfying voting experience. You have the skills. You have the kindness. Please put them to good use. —Thanks! *********** And don’t miss out on the ending soon offer for regularly $4.29 Northwoods Seasoning and $5.95 Ground Red Chipotle at just $2 each.  For almost a year now we’ve been running a featured Spice and Seasoning at just $2 apiece to welcome in those on a budget and to help make it a little easier to put together a nice collection of Spices. This is one of our best combos of the year, in part because with these two, the $2 price tag means big savings. But these two are also two of our best, simply because of how fun they are to use and how quick they are to bring smiles. Yes, as Cooks we are always having to heal the world, and at times are even called to save it, but along the way we do get to enjoy some pretty tasty food, don’t we? Northwoods Seasonings is one of our very best and most all-purpose blends, so tasty for potatoes, fish, vinegar and oil salads, chicken, baked vegetables, and steak and eggs, separately or together. Plus, Northwoods is so easy to use. Sprinkle on a little or a lot, it’s up to you, and either way you’re going to make those you cook for even happier that they have someone like you in their lives.   To see our Northwoods Seasoning click here: https://www.penzeys.com/…/northwoods-season…/c-24/p-423/pd-s Ground Red Chipotle is just plain fun. This lightly smoked, ground red Jalapeño Pepper is just so right in so many ways. Sure, the green Jalapeños have their place, but how the flavor changes as the Peppers mature from green to red is something special. Add in the light smoke and mellow heat and you have a Spice worthy of a place upon your shelf. But don’t let it sit there, add it to everything. Start simple, maybe an egg, or an avocado, or even a grilled cheese sandwich. Chipotle will open doors for you. Give it a try.

In our stores, and online at penzeys.com And as we said to those on our email list: These are tough times for those who love the American pursuit of ever greater equality. But in Republicans’ Lance Armstronging their response to all the charges they and their Supreme Court candidate are facing, it is clear their dance is coming to an end. When the facts are on your side, argue the facts. When the law is on your side, argue the law. When neither is on your side, bang your shoe on the table. From witnessing the events of this past week, this group is going to be in need of a good cobbler very soon. For Penzeys most popular Cobbler Recipe click here: https://www.penzeys.com/…/recipes/spiced-blackberry-cobbler/ Please sign up for our email list by clicking here:  http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html The thing about flat-out denying reality is that there’s no stepping back from it. There’s no negotiation afterwards that arrives at some mutually agreeable spot. Once you choose the Lance Armstrong approach, once you choose to attack those just doing their job by exposing your crimes, you’ve started a timer that, when it goes DING, means you are done. To go the full Lance is to understand that all there is ahead for you is lifetime suspension.  The leaders of the Republican Party are now on an end-of-days run. All there is left for them is to do as much damage as they can, to the benefit of their benefactors, before time runs out. November 6th is coming soon. Remember.  And in fairness to Mr. Armstrong, as much as he cheated and destroyed lives, he also tried to do some good. Not so much with the privileged guys we’ve seen this past week.  Thanks for being Cooks.

      "URGENT: Trump and the GOP are handing the fate of our planet over to dirty fossil fuel companies. Their tax bill included even more handouts to Big Oil, propping up polluting companies at the expense of clean energy.

      "Now more than ever, Kindness can’t sit down simply because anger has stood up. — Last week in the US Senate’s Supreme Court hearing anger stood up in a big way. How we respond to this anger will go a long way towards defining who we are as a people and what we become as a nation. As Cooks know, Kindness is our greatest strength. Now is the time to use this strength to the advantage of all.  To the President, and to his supporters in congress and on the Supreme Court, anger is... not an honest emotion, anger is a tool. For too long we’ve allowed them to use their less than sincere anger and rage to cause us to step back. Not any more. They want their shouts, and the shouts of their backers, to make us feel uncertain and depressed about what is going on in our country. As depressing as they are, there is no uncertainty that the majority of Americans don’t support their using the Supreme Court to take rights away from women. This isn’t happening on our watch.  At the heart of cooking is the belief that when we give of ourselves to help others, the world becomes a better place. Through cooking we’ve come to understand the strength of kindness really can heal the world. The next great moment for kindness comes 11.6.18 on Election Day. Make your plan to vote, but please give thought to encouraging others to vote, too. You are a Cook, people look up to you. Your encouragement means everything. Let them know how important this election is. Help them put together the ingredients they need for a healthy and satisfying voting experience. You have the skills. You have the kindness. Please put them to good use. —Thanks! *********** And don’t miss out on the ending soon offer for regularly $4.29 Northwoods Seasoning and $5.95 Ground Red Chipotle at just $2 each.  For almost a year now we’ve been running a featured Spice and Seasoning at just $2 apiece to welcome in those on a budget and to help make it a little easier to put together a nice collection of Spices. This is one of our best combos of the year, in part because with these two, the $2 price tag means big savings. But these two are also two of our best, simply because of how fun they are to use and how quick they are to bring smiles. Yes, as Cooks we are always having to heal the world, and at times are even called to save it, but along the way we do get to enjoy some pretty tasty food, don’t we? Northwoods Seasonings is one of our very best and most all-purpose blends, so tasty for potatoes, fish, vinegar and oil salads, chicken, baked vegetables, and steak and eggs, separately or together.

To see our Northwoods Seasoning click here: https://www.penzeys.com/…/northwoods-season…/c-24/p-423/pd-s Ground Red Chipotle is just plain fun. This lightly smoked, ground red Jalapeño Pepper is just so right in so many ways. Sure, the green Jalapeños have their place, but how the flavor changes as the Peppers mature from green to red is something special. Add in the light smoke and mellow heat and you have a Spice worthy of a place upon your shelf. But don’t let it sit there, add it to everything. Start simple, maybe an egg, or an avocado, or even a grilled cheese sandwich. Chipotle will open doors for you. Give it a try.

But in Republicans’ Lance Armstronging their response to all the charges they and their Supreme Court candidate are facing, it is clear their dance is coming to an end.

      "UPDATE: We have $275 of the $800 we need. This isn't a post of a dog with injuries, but the need is just as real if we are going to save dogs. Please help us reach our goal. Whatever you can donate is deeply appreciated.   Thank you.  It is summer in the South which means it is very hot. Besides Christmas, it is also the time most dogs are abandoned or surrendered which means the shelters are full to overflowing and the vets are booked up with spay and neuter surgeries and tr...ansports are sold out in advance. This means that, way too often, the dogs we are trying to help have to go into boarding until we can make arrangements to get their vetting or onto transport and it is often hard to find space in boarding. Boarding charges rack up quickly and the expense keeps us from being able to help as many dogs as we would like. Wonderful dogs are lost when we can’t help and we hate it! Pictured are some of the dogs we have in boarding. Some of their stories you know and some are coming up.  So, today, we are asking for your help with boarding charges and hoping you can see, as we do, how critical these funds are to our being able to help in desperate circumstances.  These dogs, Ralph, Mishka, and Addison, we couldn’t have helped had we not been able to board them. There are others. Can you please help? We would like to raise $800  for our boarding fund. It will help. It will really help. Our volunteers come from all over. I live in GA. I cannot tell you how many times this summer I have heard shelter and vet staff people say what an awful summer this has been for dogs and cats around here, how many desperately need help for many reasons. Help us have more #feelgoodfriday posts and you have a #feelgoodfriday knowing your donation has helped to save a dog in need. We are all grateful.

      "THE CHRONICLE CAN'T EVEN PRETEND FOR THREE WEEKS ABOUT ITS BLATANT DOWNTOWN BIAS! In a City that is choking on Gold Rush-scale employment growth - with its housing market totally out of control and its transportation systems collapsing as a result - and only months after the gigantic Trump corporate tax cuts obscenely enriched the coffers of all local companies    (including the Hearst Corporation*), the Chronicle nonetheless finds a 'lede' for an alarmist article: Somehow th...e proposed $350 Million per year business tax to double the City's Homeless programs that just qualified for the November City ballot will drive \"middle class\" jobs away! (Of course the Big Boom is actually creating tens of thousands of new SF jobs for people moving here from all over the USA and the World instead of local residents ... but that's just an irrelevant minor detail, right?) This same old \"Jobs\" trope to excuse the City's Elite Establishment's opposition to Progressive ballot measures for social justice taxes and rational development controls   goes back decades to the 1960's. And it was the Big Excuse  for the brutal bulldozer redevelopment projects in the Western Addition and South of Market too that destroyed entire low-income Neighborhoods. Jobs! Always Jobs! But! San Francisco voters aren't so stupid anymore to fall for this BS. Our TODCO voter poll done just a month ago (see the question in the first Comment below) tested this very argument (saw it coming a mile away, Kron Kids!). What was the positive response to it? a BIG FAT 39% agreement! Vs. 59% who found it \"not convincing\" or \"fake\"! OMG, has the Chron no shame at all? To smirkingly trot out such a pathetically trite hackneyed gaslight cliche yet once again in a preposterously obvious and incongruent reality context - in its \"News\" coverage no less? *btw: i didn't see a note/disclaimer in the article acknowledging that the Chronicle/Hearst Corporation would have to pay this new tax - did i miss it? just, you know, for the sake of journalistic ethics??\n",

      "Now more than ever, Kindness can’t sit down simply because anger has stood up. — Last week in the US Senate’s Supreme Court hearing anger stood up in a big way. How we respond to this anger will go a long way towards defining who we are as a people and what we become as a nation. As Cooks know, Kindness is our greatest strength. Now is the time to use this strength to the advantage of all.  To the President, and to his supporters in congress and on the Supreme Court, anger is... not an honest emotion, anger is a tool. For too long we’ve allowed them to use their less than sincere anger and rage to cause us to step back. Not any more. They want their shouts, and the shouts of their backers, to make us feel uncertain and depressed about what is going on in our country. As depressing as they are, there is no uncertainty that the majority of Americans don’t support their using the Supreme Court to take rights away from women. This isn’t happening on our watch.  At the heart of cooking is the belief that when we give of ourselves to help others, the world becomes a better place. Through cooking we’ve come to understand the strength of kindness really can heal the world. The next great moment for kindness comes 11.6.18 on Election Day. Make your plan to vote, but please give thought to encouraging others to vote, too. You are a Cook, people look up to you. Your encouragement means everything. Let them know how important this election is. Help them put together the ingredients they need for a healthy and satisfying voting experience. You have the skills. You have the kindness. Please put them to good use. —Thanks! *********** And don’t miss out on the ending soon offer for regularly $4.29 Northwoods Seasoning and $5.95 Ground Red Chipotle at just $2 each.  For almost a year now we’ve been running a featured Spice and Seasoning at just $2 apiece to welcome in those on a budget and to help make it a little easier to put together a nice collection of Spices. This is one of our best combos of the year, in part because with these two, the $2 price tag means big savings. But these two are also two of our best, simply because of how fun they are to use and how quick they are to bring smiles. Yes, as Cooks we are always having to heal the world, and at times are even called to save it, but along the way we do get to enjoy some pretty tasty food, don’t we? Northwoods Seasonings is one of our very best and most all-purpose blends, so tasty for potatoes, fish, vinegar and oil salads, chicken, baked vegetables, and steak and eggs, separately or together. Plus, Northwoods is so easy to use. Sprinkle on a little or a lot, it’s up to you, and either way you’re going to make those you cook for even happier that they have someone like you in their lives.   To see our Northwoods Seasoning click here: https://www.penzeys.com/…/northwoods-season…/c-24/p-423/pd-s Ground Red Chipotle is just plain fun. This lightly smoked, ground red Jalapeño Pepper is just so right in so many ways. Sure, the green Jalapeños have their place, but how the flavor changes as the Peppers mature from green to red is something special. Add in the light smoke and mellow heat and you have a Spice worthy of a place upon your shelf. But don’t let it sit there, add it to everything. Start simple, maybe an egg, or an avocado, or even a grilled cheese sandwich. Chipotle will open doors for you. Give it a try.

When the facts are on your side, argue the facts. When the law is on your side, argue the law. When neither is on your side, bang your shoe on the table.

There’s no negotiation afterwards that arrives at some mutually agreeable spot. Once you choose the Lance Armstrong approach, once you choose to attack those just doing their job by exposing your crimes, you’ve started a timer that, when it goes DING, means you are done. To go the full Lance is to understand that all there is ahead for you is lifetime suspension.  The leaders of the Republican Party are now on an end-of-days run. All there is left for them is to do as much damage as they can, to the benefit of their benefactors, before time runs out. November 6th is coming soon. Remember.

      "Now more than ever, Kindness can’t sit down simply because anger has stood up. — Last week in the US Senate’s Supreme Court hearing anger stood up in a big way. How we respond to this anger will go a long way towards defining who we are as a people and what we become as a nation. As Cooks know, Kindness is our greatest strength. Now is the time to use this strength to the advantage of all.  To the President, and to his supporters in congress and on the Supreme Court, anger is... not an honest emotion, anger is a tool. For too long we’ve allowed them to use their less than sincere anger and rage to cause us to step back. Not any more. They want their shouts, and the shouts of their backers, to make us feel uncertain and depressed about what is going on in our country. As depressing as they are, there is no uncertainty that the majority of Americans don’t support their using the Supreme Court to take rights away from women. This isn’t happening on our watch.  At the heart of cooking is the belief that when we give of ourselves to help others, the world becomes a better place. Through cooking we’ve come to understand the strength of kindness really can heal the world. The next great moment for kindness comes 11.6.18 on Election Day. Make your plan to vote, but please give thought to encouraging others to vote, too. You are a Cook, people look up to you. Your encouragement means everything. Let them know how important this election is. Help them put together the ingredients they need for a healthy and satisfying voting experience. You have the skills. You have the kindness.

But these two are also two of our best, simply because of how fun they are to use and how quick they are to bring smiles.

To see our Northwoods Seasoning click here: https://www.penzeys.com/…/northwoods-season…/c-24/p-423/pd-s Ground Red Chipotle is just plain fun. This lightly smoked, ground red Jalapeño Pepper is just so right in so many ways. Sure, the green Jalapeños have their place, but how the flavor changes as the Peppers mature from green to red is something special. Add in the light smoke and mellow heat and you have a Spice worthy of a place upon your shelf. But don’t let it sit there, add it to everything.

      "Free yourself. Live a life you truly love &amp; adore. ❤️ It’s time to let go of all your unwanted feelings, issues, and blockages to your goals at the core so you can: 😍   Be your true Self, free from limiting patterns ❤️   Feel great for no reason whatsoever  🌴   And be, do &amp; have all that you deeply desire within your heart, easily &amp; effortlessly This is paradise, waiting to be revealed within your own being. 😍❤️🌴 The question is: What is the most efficient way of going about this? Before we talk about that, it’s helpful to take a look at how we create our life experience first. So how do we do that? In my experience, we are already whole, complete, and free. We are already the freedom, the inner peace, the wholeness, the completeness, the oneness, the unconditional love, the joy, the harmony, the abundance, the power, the fulfillment, and more that we seem to be looking for outside of ourselves. We are already our true Self. The reason why we may not feel that way yet is because that seems to be covered up with layers upon layers of limiting thoughts &amp; feelings that we are identified with. This thing that we call the ego. All the pain, the suffering, and the discomfort we experience in life comes from this. For most of us, some of these limiting thoughts &amp; feelings are conscious but most of them are subconscious. And the totality of what we hold in our consciousness defines not only the way we feel “internally”, but also the “reality” that we experience “externally”. Note: In reality, there is no such thing as “inside” &amp; “outside” because everything is appearing in our consciousness. The only reason why it feels that way is because we are carrying a sense of separation that makes us feel that way. But we’ll use those words for ease of communication. “Internally”, those thoughts &amp; feelings are what gets us into action or prevents us from taking action, and “externally”, life acts like a mirror that reflects to us those thoughts &amp; feelings, in the form of situations, events, interactions with people, and anything else we may experience. What we call “life” is a projection or a reflection of our consciousness. “Life does not happen to you. It responds to you.” –Anonymous So if we want to change what life is reflecting to us, we need to let go of what’s creating that experience within us. ❤️   If we want to accomplish certain goals, we need to let go of whatever is not in alignment with those goals within us. ❤️  If we no longer want to experience certain thoughts &amp; feelings, obviously, we need to let them go. ❤️   And if we want to realize our true Self, the true nature of reality, we need to let go of the false self or illusory self, aka the ego. So now the question is: “What is the most efficient way of going about this?”, “What is the most efficient way of unraveling, dissolving, letting go of this sense of limitation, of this ego?”. To answer that question, I will share with you the journey that I have experienced as that is relevant for this next part. When I started releasing the blockages in my subconscious, the initial method that I was drawn to was all about changing the root belief systems that were blocking the flow in a particular area of life. And initially, I got some pretty amazing results with this technique, but when it came down to actually working on the things that I really wanted to achieve, and the places where I felt really stuck, this method could not take me there, not even close. The curve of progression that was initially so amazing completely flattened, and even hit a dead end. And I intuitively knew that I had to go deeper into the subconscious, to the place where I was holding all these limiting patterns, all these blockages. And the other thing was that, in this initial method, there was a root belief system here, and a root belief system there, and a bunch of root belief systems everywhere, and being a big fan of common denominators, and how the simplest truths, the core truths are the most powerful, it got me thinking about: “What is at the core of all of these “root” belief systems?”. I felt that if we knew what was at the core, how that core was designed, that we could reverse-engineer it or, in this case, that we could dissolve it in a very direct &amp; efficient way, which could dramatically simplify &amp; speed up this process. I wanted a way to do that that was easy &amp; universal, that everybody could use because on some level, I knew that I would be sharing this with many people at some point. And so I started asking: “What is at the core of all this suffering &amp; discomfort that we experience?”, “What is at the core of the ego?”, “What is it made of?”, “Show me the core of the ego.”.  “The simplest truths are the most powerful.” –Anonymous From then on, through some amazing realizations of the true nature of reality, working with a few key Self-realized teachers that specifically knew about the design of the ego (they are very rare), and an extremely powerful method that I will be sharing with you , “life” has taken me deeper and deeper into the layers of the subconscious until it revealed the full structure of this sense of limitation. I realized along the way that it wasn’t just about what was at the core. It was about the full structure of this sense of limitation from the surface of our consciousness all the way to the core. There are a few key layers that need to be addressed to properly dissolve this in an efficient way. And I can tell you that there is an inner duality that is operating in our subconscious that is keeping us stuck living a limited &amp; uncomfortable “reality”, that very few methods or Self-realized teachers talk about. Additionally, while there are some great insights that many spiritual teachers share about the ego, the sense of identification, the sense of “me” or “I”, in my experience, the technique that dissolves that identification in a practical, methodical, and reliable way was missing. I was surprised to find that this knowledge was so rare &amp; so difficult to access, even for someone that had been specifically looking for it. Then again, it made sense that the answers only came when I was really ready for them, when I was really ready to break free. As the quote goes, “When the student is ready, the teacher appears.”, and it certainly played out that way in my experience. And if you are reading this, chances are, you are ready to break free too. And for that, I am super excited for you, that you gave yourself access to this powerful combination of knowledge, method, and guidance. 🙏🏼❤️ About me: My name is Chamsi. I help people let go of unwanted feelings, issues, and blockages to their goals at the core so they can be their true Self, free from limiting patterns; feel great for no reason whatsoever; and be, do &amp; have all that they desire deep within their heart, easily &amp; effortlessly. 😍❤️🌴 In this complimentary guide to releasing at the core, I will be sharing with you: ❤️   An overview of how this sense of limitation we are identified with, this “ego” structure (that gives rise to all the unwanted feelings, issues, and blockages to goals), is designed from the surface of our consciousness all the way to the core ❤️   The amazing method that I use for myself &amp; my clients to dissolve this sense of limitation in a simple, efficient, and powerful way ❤️   And if you want to unlock your specific blockages at the core, and in an accelerated way, you will have access to working with me, along with a wonderful incentive to try this work for yourself. In my experience &amp; that of the people that I work with, access to this knowledge, method, and guidance is absolutely priceless &amp; life-changing, and if applied, it can save you years, decades, and more in pain &amp; suffering.

      "Now more than ever, Kindness can’t sit down simply because anger has stood up. — Last week in the US Senate’s Supreme Court hearing anger stood up in a big way. How we respond to this anger will go a long way towards defining who we are as a people and what we become as a nation. As Cooks know, Kindness is our greatest strength. Now is the time to use this strength to the advantage of all.  To the President, and to his supporters in congress and on the Supreme Court, anger is... not an honest emotion, anger is a tool. For too long we’ve allowed them to use their less than sincere anger and rage to cause us to step back. Not any more. They want their shouts, and the shouts of their backers, to make us feel uncertain and depressed about what is going on in our country. As depressing as they are, there is no uncertainty that the majority of Americans don’t support their using the Supreme Court to take rights away from women. This isn’t happening on our watch.  At the heart of cooking is the belief that when we give of ourselves to help others, the world becomes a better place. Through cooking we’ve come to understand the strength of kindness really can heal the world. The next great moment for kindness comes 11.6.18 on Election Day. Make your plan to vote, but please give thought to encouraging others to vote, too. You are a Cook, people look up to you. Your encouragement means everything. Let them know how important this election is. Help them put together the ingredients they need for a healthy and satisfying voting experience. You have the skills. You have the kindness. Please put them to good use. —Thanks! *********** And don’t miss out on the ending soon offer for regularly $4.29 Northwoods Seasoning and $5.95 Ground Red Chipotle at just $2 each.  For almost a year now we’ve been running a featured Spice and Seasoning at just $2 apiece to welcome in those on a budget and to help make it a little easier to put together a nice collection of Spices. This is one of our best combos of the year, in part because with these two, the $2 price tag means big savings. But these two are also two of our best, simply because of how fun they are to use and how quick they are to bring smiles. Yes, as Cooks we are always having to heal the world, and at times are even called to save it, but along the way we do get to enjoy some pretty tasty food, don’t we? Northwoods Seasonings is one of our very best and most all-purpose blends, so tasty for potatoes, fish, vinegar and oil salads, chicken, baked vegetables, and steak and eggs, separately or together. Plus, Northwoods is so easy to use. Sprinkle on a little or a lot, it’s up to you, and either way you’re going to make those you cook for even happier that they have someone like you in their lives.   To see our Northwoods Seasoning click here: https://www.penzeys.com/…/northwoods-season…/c-24/p-423/pd-s Ground Red Chipotle is just plain fun. This lightly smoked, ground red Jalapeño Pepper is just so right in so many ways. Sure, the green Jalapeños have their place, but how the flavor changes as the Peppers mature from green to red is something special.

And as we said to those on our email list: These are tough times for those who love the American pursuit of ever greater equality. But in Republicans’ Lance Armstronging their response to all the charges they and their Supreme Court candidate are facing, it is clear their dance is coming to an end. When the facts are on your side, argue the facts. When the law is on your side, argue the law. When neither is on your side, bang your shoe on the table. From witnessing the events of this past week, this group is going to be in need of a good cobbler very soon. For Penzeys most popular Cobbler Recipe click here: https://www.penzeys.com/…/recipes/spiced-blackberry-cobbler/ Please sign up for our email list by clicking here:  http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html The thing about flat-out denying reality is that there’s no stepping back from it. There’s no negotiation afterwards that arrives at some mutually agreeable spot. Once you choose the Lance Armstrong approach, once you choose to attack those just doing their job by exposing your crimes, you’ve started a timer that, when it goes DING, means you are done. To go the full Lance is to understand that all there is ahead for you is lifetime suspension.  The leaders of the Republican Party are now on an end-of-days run. All there is left for them is to do as much damage as they can, to the benefit of their benefactors, before time runs out. November 6th is coming soon. Remember.  And in fairness to Mr. Armstrong, as much as he cheated and destroyed lives, he also tried to do some good. Not so much with the privileged guys we’ve seen this past week.  Thanks for being Cooks. You bring hope to the world, Bill Penzey bill@penzeys.com Thanks again.

      "Executive Director Statement on #December17 #RestInPower and End of the Year Fundraising  \"I began volunteering as a board member with SWOP-USA in the fall of 2015, I had been doing sex work formally for 8 years, and had been doing social justice organizing for 14. I was raised as a liberal feminist and considered sex work to be a violation. I actually protested a Girls Gone Wild recording at a bar in my college town, I’m ashamed of it, but it happened. At a certain point I r...an out of money and had to take some time off of school, I worked retail and it was grueling and I was constantly harassed by mall customers and employees. Despite my reservations, I started doing sex work, expecting to hate it, but low and behold is has become my most long-lasting and consistent work.  I came into this new project, as many organizers do - naive, ambitious, and with the firm belief that tremendous change was just around the corner. After three years on the board and eventually transitioning to the role of inaugural Executive Director of SWOP-USA, I can rest assured it’s a much longer journey than I had ever anticipated. The fight for sex workers rights is complicated and nuanced; best practices of the past aren’t sufficient.  We are at a crucial moment in the sex workers rights movement. Our elders fought long and hard for the safety and dignity that we benefit from today, but it is not enough. We come into another December 17th with staggering numbers of sex workers who have lost their lives to violence. 2018 was a year that we saw brutal violence committed against Women of Color domestically, abroad, and at the border. Everyone knows and loves someone who is a sex worker, and those sex workers intersect with and experience every other system of oppression and institution of violence.  Decriminalization as a public health and harm reduction strategy remains an essential pillar of SWOP-USA’s mission. Additionally, we must address the larger systems that would make decriminalization only a benefit to those already in positions of power. Criminalization spans much further than sex workers, and it impacts us differently. Black and Brown and trans individuals would continue to face extreme policing and violence even if we achieved decriminalization tomorrow. Our struggle must be intersectional, or it is lost.  This past October, the SWOP-USA Board of Directors and myself participated in the early stages of our strategic planning. One of the processes we engaged with was to imagine what December 17th events could look like in 15 years. It was a struggle for many of us to look so far into the future and try to imagine something brighter, more just, a world transitioning away from white supremacy and criminalization.  One of the most tangible points that came out of this conversation was that up until now we have only honored sex workers who have lost their lives. We had previously failed to name many other forms of violence, violence that is not always immediately fatal - such as incarceration, violence resulting from white supremacy, trans erasure, stigma, poverty, drug use, and so much more. This year and for all the years to come, we must center the voices and experiences of those impacted by all forms of criminalization.  We believe that the work of building power and developing activists' skills is essential to moving forward as a movement. We need a movement of leaders if we want to win, and we believe that sex workers will win.  We could not do this work without our direct community or our generous donors and funders. We did not meet our goals for foundation funding for 2019, as unfortunately few foundations directly support our fight, and we are in danger of not being able to move forward with some of our funding. We need you to you to help keep moving our grassroots organizing forward. We currently are running our end of the year fundraising drive in order to continue to support our chapters and projects. Any contribution (tax deductible!) would be tremendously appreciated and goes directly to funding sex worker-led organizing.  https://givingtuesday.mightycause.com/story/Swopusa2018 Thank you so much for your support.

      "Now more than ever, Kindness can’t sit down simply because anger has stood up. — Last week in the US Senate’s Supreme Court hearing anger stood up in a big way. How we respond to this anger will go a long way towards defining who we are as a people and what we become as a nation. As Cooks know, Kindness is our greatest strength. Now is the time to use this strength to the advantage of all.  To the President, and to his supporters in congress and on the Supreme Court, anger is... not an honest emotion, anger is a tool. For too long we’ve allowed them to use their less than sincere anger and rage to cause us to step back. Not any more. They want their shouts, and the shouts of their backers, to make us feel uncertain and depressed about what is going on in our country. As depressing as they are, there is no uncertainty that the majority of Americans don’t support their using the Supreme Court to take rights away from women. This isn’t happening on our watch.  At the heart of cooking is the belief that when we give of ourselves to help others, the world becomes a better place. Through cooking we’ve come to understand the strength of kindness really can heal the world. The next great moment for kindness comes 11.6.18 on Election Day. Make your plan to vote, but please give thought to encouraging others to vote, too. You are a Cook, people look up to you. Your encouragement means everything. Let them know how important this election is. Help them put together the ingredients they need for a healthy and satisfying voting experience. You have the skills. You have the kindness. Please put them to good use. —Thanks! *********** And don’t miss out on the ending soon offer for regularly $4.29 Northwoods Seasoning and $5.95 Ground Red Chipotle at just $2 each.

But these two are also two of our best, simply because of how fun they are to use and how quick they are to bring smiles.

      "Recently, as we squeezed in dinner on a Monday night, my nine year old daughter reminded me of all of the sacrifices I have made as State's Attorney in Addison County. That Friday night, I had a phone call at 12:30 about an arrestee that took about forty five minutes. On Saturday morning I was awakened at 6:30 due to an untimely death. On Sunday, I spent much of the afternoon regarding the tragic death of Deane Rubright. That night I was dealing with a fatal drug overdose. Th...at's just a typical weekend. Often times I have miss planned events, like when one of my oldest friends, a guy I've known since childhood, flew home to Vermont from Oakland to celebrate his fiftieth birthday up in Isle La Motte. I was supposed to attend, but spent most of the day with the Vermont State Police in New  because a man shot his son in the back in Goshen. My friend returned to California. Never got to see him. Victims and perpetrators of crime in Addison aren't always local either. The work often takes me out of state, such as two sex assault cases I have prosecuted in the past couple years where the victims resided in southern New Hampshire. I met with these women in their homes, and spent many days of depositions on other occasions down near their seacoast homes. I even lived out of a hotel for a week in White River Junction to convict one of their attackers at trial. I don't write this to complain, because I would have it no other way. I write this to illustrate the level of commitment I have shown to ensuring justice for Addison County. This is just another way that I'm already working for you. Please vote for me to remain as your State's Attorney.\n",

      "The New V Pin Is In! —Be prepared to Smile.  V-pin/Hot Chocolate/Thyme/Cajun free w $5 spend So WWII, a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. In Europe, everyone knew just what the war was and just what was at stake. In America, the war was not right outside our front door, it was somehow distant. To turn back Nationalist Fascism, every American needed to do their all. So the V for Victory campaign was launched.  We, too, are now in the midst of a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. 11.8.16 was a shock, but the incredible effort of so many since has made the incredible turnaround of 11.6.18 possible. Be proud! But now comes the next two years which, if we are to turn back the Republican Party’s new Nationalism, are even more important than the last two. How do we stay focused with our eyes on the prize? Meet our new V pin, inspired by the V pins of 75 years ago when we last faced this very same challenge. Our V pin is small but surprisingly powerful. And through Sunday it is yours free with any purchase.  There’s also a Thanksgiving to be celebrated. This Thursday it’s time to once again be reminded that what our country is, what makes it unique, is not anything Europeans brought with them, but instead was a gift given at great cost from the Wampanoag people. Abraham Lincoln made Thanksgiving our third national holiday after the 4th of July and Washington’s Birthday at the height of the Civil War as a reminder of the spirit of welcome to all that set this country in motion. This Thursday, please give thanks to our Native American community for teaching us what it means to be American. So our best Turkey Seasoning, the regularly $4.29 Bicentennial Rub, a Colonial mix of the Spices of the day, is just $1 along with regularly $2.95 Rubbed Sage for your stuffing. Plus $19.95 Kind Heart Boxes for just $12.50. To see Bicentennial Rub for turkey click this link: https://www.penzeys.com/online-cata…/bicentennial-rub/…/pd-s For Rubbed Sage please click here: https://www.penzeys.com/online-cat…/sage-rubbed/…/p-804/pd-s To see the cheerful Kind Hart Box please click on this link: https://www.penzeys.com/…/gift-pack-kind-…/c-24/p-1568/pd-gb Plus, we are on the verge of the holiday season, so we are doing our best to entice you in with a free $4.29 Penzeys Hot Chocolate and $4.28 combined value French Thyme and Cajun Seasoning. And where sometimes it’s your choice of the offers with $5, both with $10, this time a single $5 in spending gets you both offers and the very cool new V pin as well. With all this going on now’s a good time to visit us online at penzeys.com, or at all of our stores but one.  Sadly, Saturday won’t be a good day to visit our Philadelphia Store, as the building we are in will be closed because of actual Nazis actually marching right outside our actual front door. We aren’t the draw, it’s Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell across the street that they will be there for. Our next-door neighbor is the National Museum of American Jewish History. In the wake of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting not even a month ago, Saturday will be a tough day for them. Can we stop pretending that this president or the Republican Party that is now fully in his control are anything good people should still support? Please get your V pin. In our stores or online there is no coupon or code needed for the free with purchase V pin, $1 Bicentennial and Rubbed Sage and the good deal on the Kind Heart Boxes. All those are automatic for everyone.  To get your in store coupons good for the free with $5 purchase $8.57 combined value Hot Chocolate French Thyme and Cajun Seasoning, please click this link: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html Online at penzeys.com after spending at least $5 enter 15653C in the apply code box at checkout for the Hot Chocolate, and then enter 20822C in the same box for the Thyme and Cajun. No need to add any of these to your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. While I have you, if you are lucky enough to have $18 to spare, can you give thought to the people at the National Museum of American Jewish History next door to our Philadelphia Store? Hate has a way of wearing even the strongest of us down, and the amount of hate that’s been allowed to be directed towards America’s Jewish community in these last two years is staggering. Add in the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting that so many rushed to get behind us, and the thought of actual Nazis marching outside of their door is simply too much for any slice of the American pie to have to face alone. The museum has their donations page set up in $18 increments. A bunch of us visiting their page and leaving $18 to say someone they never met cares about them would mean a lot. You can find their donation page here: https://support.nmajh.org/annualfund And a special thanks to the kind people of Philadelphia. Since Friday’s email went out, the response from those who have no intention of sitting their kindness down simply because anger has shown up to march their streets is inspiring. Cooking really is caring about people. There’s reasons why America was born in Philadelphia. With the spirit of its people, rest assured it won’t be ending there anytime soon. America stands with you. Please be sure to get your V pin when you can. These are exciting times. Thank you for your support, Bill bill@penzeys.com Liking this post, liking our FB page, and more importantly leaving a comment helps offset the extra hurdles our posts face due to our “political” belief that cooking is what happens when you care about people.

      "Today, our friends at Northside Transformative Law Center succeeding in getting Marquise's murder case dismissed after he spent 2.5 years in Cook County Jail. Marquise's case is a critical reminder that the presumption of innocence applies to everyone who is accused of a crime, not only people who are charged with \"minor\" offenses. Whether it was because he couldn't afford to pay his bond or because he was not given bond, Marquise's freedom was taken away before trial, and he... will never get those 2.5 years back. Here is NTLC's full press release about the story: In a tremendous victory, the Northside Transformative Law Center (NTLC) and Willis and Associates secured the dismissal of murder charges against 22-year-old Marquise Willis.  Mr. Willis spent over two years in Cook County Jail, falsely accused of killing one of his closest friends. 'We welcome the State’s Attorney’s decision to dismiss a case that should never have been charged in the first place,' says NTLC Attorney Emmanuel Andre. 'Looking at the evidence, we cannot understand why this case was ever pursued. The victim’s family consistently told law enforcement and investigators that Marquise was not the person responsible for the murder of their loved one. Once Marquise was arrested and charges were approved, he was treated as guilty until we could prove his innocence.  Fortunately, with hard work and the support of the victim’s family, we were able to do so.' NTLC hopes that the Chicago Police Department will assign new law enforcement personnel to conduct an independent investigation in order to explain the false arrest of Marquise Willis and help the victim’s family find closure. Marquise and his family seek a formal apology from the State’s Attorney’s Office and the Chicago Police Department for the unsubstantiated arrest, prosecution and detention of Marquise Willis. Additionally, there are extremely important lessons that decision makers in the criminal justice system should learn from this situation. This young man was devastated after being locked up, away from his loved ones and deprived of his freedom, while falsely accused of murdering his friend. Mr. Willis will never get back the time he spent in Cook County Jail, and his family will bear the consequences and scars of this injustice throughout their lives. 'We are grateful to everyone who worked tirelessly to see justice prevail in this case,” says Andre. 'At the same time, it is unfortunate that our larger community failed to protect a young man from a broken system that claims far too many lives. There are lessons to be learned, and substantive changes to our legal system are long overdue. As Marquise navigates the complicated transition back into society, we ask that community service providers and small businesses join together to help Marquise, in the form of employment, education, and health care, that he greatly needs.'\"\n",

      "Swamp Ethics: An Examination of Trump’s Environmental and Energy Cabinet Members through an Oregon Ethical Lens Several of Trump’s cabinet members have come under scrutiny for scandals that raise serious ethical concerns. For example, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has made headlines for entering into a sweetheart rental arrangement with a fossil fuel lobbyist; exploiting an obscure provision of the Safe Drinking Water Act to authorize staff raises the White House had previou...sly denied; and staying involved in cases as EPA Administrator even though, in his previous role as Oklahoma’s attorney general, he represented an opposing party on the same matters. Additionally, Administrator Pruitt and Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke are reportedly under investigation for using government funds to fly first-class and on private jets to attend meetings with donors. And Secretary of Energy Rick Perry has been diligently working to implement an agenda secretly provided to him by an energy company—the disclosure of which resulted in the termination of a Department of Energy photographer. Several independent investigations of these and other actions are underway in D.C., and Pruitt, the lone attorney among the three cabinet members, is facing a bar complaint in his home state of Oklahoma. Imagine these and other members of the Trump Administration’s environmental and energy agencies were licensed lawyers in Oregon. Would any of their actions raise ethical concerns under Oregon law? If so, which ones? What remedies are available, if any?  If not, what does that say about Oregon’s ethics rules? Please join the Green Energy Institute at Lewis &amp; Clark Law School on Wednesday, May 30, for a lively discussion of ethical obligation and accountability under the Trump Administration. This CLE seminar will explore the actions of President Trump’s environmental, energy, and natural resources agency appointees and ask ethics experts to weigh in on whether the actions of these agency leaders would violate Oregon’s ethics rules. Hosted at Vestas corporate office 1417 NW Everett St, Portland Speakers include: - Steve Johansen, Professor of Law and Director, Lawyering Program at Lewis &amp; Clark Law School - Ted Reuter, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel at Oregon State Bar This event is open to the public, but prior registration is required. We will be applying for 1.0 ethics MCLE credit from the Oregon State Bar. Lunch and beverages will be provided. Space is limited, so please register today!\n",

      "UPDATE: Legislative leadership just invoked the nuclear option with respect to the budget. For the first time in modern history, it appears our budget will be passed as a conference report instead of a regular bill.  Why does this matter? Because a conference report gets to skip over the committee process and isn't subject to any amendments.  That means that whenever we see the budget - and it's still being written behind closed doors - it's essentially final.  And we're hearing the budget vote will be as soon as next week, so without having seen a single line of it, it's basically done.  You only pull a move like this if you are so entrenched in power that you're ok with openly insulting every taxpayer in the state.  Think of it like driving over your neighbor's mailbox while giving them a thumbs up. You only do something like that if you've become totally detached from what people think of you.  If you're a fiscal hawk, you should be especially concerned by the fact that this budget will spend $23 billion of your tax money without anyone being able to publicly question or amend a single letter of it.  Ultimately, this is about teachers. Republicans know that Democrats are going to offer amendments to raise teacher pay and Republicans don't want to be on record voting against that. So they're going to torpedo the whole process to avoid publicly saying \"No\" to teachers. Add this to your list of reasons why voting this November is absolutely essential.\n",

      "Why did I reduce the PFD in 2016?  Before you make up your mind on the decisions about the budget and the fiscal plan, please take three minutes to watch this video.  The decision to reduce the PFD in 2016 in response to Alaska’s fiscal crisis will be one of the defining issues of this election. Our opponents on both the left and the right have criticized this decision. Some Alaskans believe that it was a terrible decision that we never should have considered -- that this dec...ision was unnecessary, that if we had cut more out of state government, we could have avoided making any changes to the way we manage the Permanent Fund. Other Alaskans believe that restructuring the Permanent Fund was an essential step to creating a long term fiscal plan and to making sure that the Permanent Fund and the Dividend could continue to grow for future generations. One of the main reasons I ran four years ago was because Alaska was running a large deficit ($1.6 billion) and nobody was talking about it. This gap between our spending and what we were bringing in could have been addressed by budget cuts alone, without a PFD reduction or any new revenue… However, days after we were elected, the price of oil collapsed to $26/barrell, reducing state revenues by more than eighty percent. Alaska went from having the largest savings account in the country to the largest budget deficit of any state in the country ($3.7 billion)... overnight.  In our first year, before we looked at any changes to the Fund, we went to work to reduce the state budget. We did not want to propose changes before we had cut everything we felt we could. That meant closing over 40 state facilities. It meant a loss of 77 positions at the Department of Public Safety alone (and that was the Department with one of the smallest reductions). It meant reducing the state spending by 44%, or $1.7 billion, from 2013. Ultimately, we reduced the budget down to 2007 levels, with state employment at its lowest level in fifteen years. Additional cuts would mean hurting our schools. Additional cuts would mean cutting the people that keep our roads and airports running. Additional cuts would mean cutting our ability to fund troopers, prosecutors, and our response to the opioid epidemic. Additional cuts would mean cutting the things that keep businesses and workers invested in Alaska. Additional cuts would mean eliminating our state share of Federal grants that match our share up to ten times over. We will continue to look for ways to reduce the budget and spend our money smarter. But we are literally at the point where large additional cuts could cost us more money then they would save.  That's why, while you see both of our opponents advocating for \"additional cuts\", you won't see them specify where those cuts should go. Alaskans knew that we could not cut our way out of the fiscal crisis we were in. The alternative was either make some changes, or just completely spend down our savings. And that's what the Legislature chose to do. Rather than risk the political cost of change, the Legislature spent down $14 billion in savings. That's fourteen billion that we will never have back to invest in our schools, infrastructure, and public safety. We were behaving like a guy who loses his job and decides to spend down all his family's savings before looking for a new job. We were about to lose the house... At the rate the Legislature was spending down our savings, and I believed that the Permanent Fund itself was at risk. Once we spent our savings, the only thing left to meet our debts would be the Permanent Fund earnings account, from which the dividend itself is paid out each year. . That put the Dividend at risk of going away. Forever. I reduced the PFD in 2016 because the Legislature had made it clear that they were not willing to be the first to take any action that would result in less money going out to Alaskans. I had Legislators tell me privately: \"We're going to make you do what we should be doing.\" I reduced the PFD in 2016 in order to leave that money in the Fund, so that it could continue to earn interest and grow the Fund, strengthening Alaska's greatest asset. Every dollar that I vetoed from the PFD stayed in the Fund. I reduced the PFD in 2016 so that the Legislature would find the courage to pass a fiscal plan compromise. That compromise has provided the stability that businesses need to invest in Alaska. It has reduced our budget deficit by 80%. It has allowed us to forward fund education rather than pink slipping our teachers at the end of every school year. It has allowed us to bring on badly needed prosecutors and troopers in the fight against opioids. Ultimately, I believe that the decision to restructure the Permanent Fund will allow both the Permanent Fund and the Dividend to grow long-term. That's what we saw this year, with the PFD increasing to $1,600, well above the historic average. The decision to reduce the PFD was the hardest decision I've ever made. It impacted many Alaskans, no question about it. Byron and I believed that the alternative would hurt much worse, by endangering the future of the Permanent Fund and the Dividend long term. I didn't make my decision because it was \"politically correct.\" My job as Governor isn't to be politically correct. My job is to put Alaska on the strongest path possible for the future. If you have questions, let us know and we'll try to answer them. If this video and this information was helpful to you, please share to your Facebook page so other Alaskans can consider it as well. Thank you for taking the time. I can't promise that you will always like the decisions I make as your Governor. But I can promise you that I will always tell you the truth and that I will always put Alaska's future first.  - Bill Walker\n",

The infamous Macau Canidrome is known as the place where greyhounds are shipped to race, waste away and ultimately die. In fact, according to one study, in just one year alone, 383 dogs were put down at the Macau race track.  If that was the death toll when the racetrack was running, it's no wonder why animal activists are worried about the 650 greyhounds that currently call the canidrome home.  They believe that before ,or by, the time the track shuts its doors all or most of the dogs could be killed — a virtual dog slaughter. All because the track has no more use for them.  Now they are asking the Macau government to step in and force the racetrack to hand the dogs over to a local animal rescue organization so they can be adopted out to loving families.  Add your name to the call to save the Macau 650. Tell the Macau government you want the dogs to be handed over to the local animal shelter.\n",

However, government red-tape too often results in our interpreters being left behind and in harm’s way.  In November 2013, Janis and I started No One Left Behind with one mission: to ensure America treats our interpreters as the heroes and veterans they are.

      "The New V Pin Is In! —Be prepared to Smile.  V-pin/Hot Chocolate/Thyme/Cajun free w $5 spend So WWII, a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. In Europe, everyone knew just what the war was and just what was at stake. In America, the war was not right outside our front door, it was somehow distant. To turn back Nationalist Fascism, every American needed to do their all. So the V for Victory campaign was launched.  We, too, are now in the midst of a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. 11.8.16 was a shock, but the incredible effort of so many since has made the incredible turnaround of 11.6.18 possible. Be proud! But now comes the next two years which, if we are to turn back the Republican Party’s new Nationalism, are even more important than the last two. How do we stay focused with our eyes on the prize? Meet our new V pin, inspired by the V pins of 75 years ago when we last faced this very same challenge. Our V pin is small but surprisingly powerful. And through Sunday it is yours free with any purchase.  There’s also a Thanksgiving to be celebrated. This Thursday it’s time to once again be reminded that what our country is, what makes it unique, is not anything Europeans brought with them, but instead was a gift given at great cost from the Wampanoag people. Abraham Lincoln made Thanksgiving our third national holiday after the 4th of July and Washington’s Birthday at the height of the Civil War as a reminder of the spirit of welcome to all that set this country in motion. This Thursday, please give thanks to our Native American community for teaching us what it means to be American. So our best Turkey Seasoning, the regularly $4.29 Bicentennial Rub, a Colonial mix of the Spices of the day, is just $1 along with regularly $2.95 Rubbed Sage for your stuffing. Plus $19.95 Kind Heart Boxes for just $12.50. To see Bicentennial Rub for turkey click this link: https://www.penzeys.com/online-cata…/bicentennial-rub/…/pd-s For Rubbed Sage please click here: https://www.penzeys.com/online-cat…/sage-rubbed/…/p-804/pd-s To see the cheerful Kind Hart Box please click on this link: https://www.penzeys.com/…/gift-pack-kind-…/c-24/p-1568/pd-gb Plus, we are on the verge of the holiday season, so we are doing our best to entice you in with a free $4.29 Penzeys Hot Chocolate and $4.28 combined value French Thyme and Cajun Seasoning. And where sometimes it’s your choice of the offers with $5, both with $10, this time a single $5 in spending gets you both offers and the very cool new V pin as well. With all this going on now’s a good time to visit us online at penzeys.com, or at all of our stores but one.  Sadly, Saturday won’t be a good day to visit our Philadelphia Store, as the building we are in will be closed because of actual Nazis actually marching right outside our actual front door. We aren’t the draw, it’s Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell across the street that they will be there for. Our next-door neighbor is the National Museum of American Jewish History. In the wake of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting not even a month ago, Saturday will be a tough day for them. Can we stop pretending that this president or the Republican Party that is now fully in his control are anything good people should still support? Please get your V pin. In our stores or online there is no coupon or code needed for the free with purchase V pin, $1 Bicentennial and Rubbed Sage and the good deal on the Kind Heart Boxes. All those are automatic for everyone.  To get your in store coupons good for the free with $5 purchase $8.57 combined value Hot Chocolate French Thyme and Cajun Seasoning, please click this link: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html Online at penzeys.com after spending at least $5 enter 15653C in the apply code box at checkout for the Hot Chocolate, and then enter 20822C in the same box for the Thyme and Cajun. No need to add any of these to your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. While I have you, if you are lucky enough to have $18 to spare, can you give thought to the people at the National Museum of American Jewish History next door to our Philadelphia Store? Hate has a way of wearing even the strongest of us down, and the amount of hate that’s been allowed to be directed towards America’s Jewish community in these last two years is staggering. Add in the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting that so many rushed to get behind us, and the thought of actual Nazis marching outside of their door is simply too much for any slice of the American pie to have to face alone. The museum has their donations page set up in $18 increments. A bunch of us visiting their page and leaving $18 to say someone they never met cares about them would mean a lot. You can find their donation page here: https://support.nmajh.org/annualfund And a special thanks to the kind people of Philadelphia. Since Friday’s email went out, the response from those who have no intention of sitting their kindness down simply because anger has shown up to march their streets is inspiring. Cooking really is caring about people. There’s reasons why America was born in Philadelphia. With the spirit of its people, rest assured it won’t be ending there anytime soon. America stands with you. Please be sure to get your V pin when you can. These are exciting times. Thank you for your support, Bill bill@penzeys.com Liking this post, liking our FB page, and more importantly leaving a comment helps offset the extra hurdles our posts face due to our “political” belief that cooking is what happens when you care about people. And if you haven’t already, please sign up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking email list; that is the biggest help of all: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html Thanks once again, Bill\n",

I also served as president of the Atlanta City Council and presided over an 18-member body. Additionally, I served as a member on the Fulton County Board of Commissioners.

All in all I am very proud of our efforts.  JULY 17, 2018 BY ADMIN N.C. House Keeps Promises to Public Schools, State Employees, P...rivate Sector 310 Share Tweet Raleigh, N.C.  – Families and businesses in North Carolina continued to see promising gains from the 2018 state legislative session as lawmakers remained committed to higher salaries for educators and state employees, increased investments in public schools and a successful pro-growth jobs agenda. The accomplishments mark another year of promises kept by the Republican-led General Assembly to deliver tax relief, a better jobs climate and dramatically higher investments in North Carolina education systems. “The promises kept by North Carolina lawmakers to dramatically increase educator and state employee pay, build a stronger public school system and grow our private sector will benefit citizens and businesses for years to come,” said state House Speaker Tim Moore (R-Cleveland).

Made North Carolina schools safer, providing $35 million for school safety initiatives, including new grant programs to support students in crisis, school safety training, safety equipment and youth mental health personnel. Took steps to reduce the testing burden on students in North Carolina and eliminate unnecessary exams not required by state or federal law. Made college far more affordable and accessible by fully funding the N.C. Promise Program to guarantee in-state students at three universities $500 tuition per semester, guaranteeing fixed-rate tuition and fees over four years for higher education students, and supporting the ConnectNC bond cash flow. Added thousands of kids to the state’s pre-K program and developed a plan to eliminate 100 percent of the state’s waitlist for at-risk children by 2021. Provided low-income families with education options through the Opportunity Scholarship program offering need-based learning opportunities to our state’s most vulnerable students.

Helped combat the opioid addiction crisis by passing the STOP Act to ensure highly-addictive prescription drugs are responsibly administered and not over-prescribed, and the HOPE Act to give law enforcement the tools they need to battle the opioid crisis. Funded the changes necessary to “raise the age” in North Carolina, ensuring 16- and 17-year olds suspected of misdemeanor offenses and less serious felonies will be tried as juveniles instead of adults by December 2019. Protected North Carolina’s family farms, passing the N.C. Farm Act of 2018 aimed at supporting the state’s largest industry and ensuring that farmers have legal protections in the state’s right to farm law.

      "Now more than ever, Kindness can’t sit down simply because anger has stood up. — Last week in the US Senate’s Supreme Court hearing anger stood up in a big way. How we respond to this anger will go a long way towards defining who we are as a people and what we become as a nation. As Cooks know, Kindness is our greatest strength. Now is the time to use this strength to the advantage of all.  To the President, and to his supporters in congress and on the Supreme Court, anger is... not an honest emotion, anger is a tool. For too long we’ve allowed them to use their less than sincere anger and rage to cause us to step back. Not any more. They want their shouts, and the shouts of their backers, to make us feel uncertain and depressed about what is going on in our country. As depressing as they are, there is no uncertainty that the majority of Americans don’t support their using the Supreme Court to take rights away from women. This isn’t happening on our watch.  At the heart of cooking is the belief that when we give of ourselves to help others, the world becomes a better place. Through cooking we’ve come to understand the strength of kindness really can heal the world. The next great moment for kindness comes 11.6.18 on Election Day. Make your plan to vote, but please give thought to encouraging others to vote, too. You are a Cook, people look up to you. Your encouragement means everything. Let them know how important this election is. Help them put together the ingredients they need for a healthy and satisfying voting experience. You have the skills. You have the kindness. Please put them to good use. —Thanks! *********** And don’t miss out on the ending soon offer for regularly $4.29 Northwoods Seasoning and $5.95 Ground Red Chipotle at just $2 each.  For almost a year now we’ve been running a featured Spice and Seasoning at just $2 apiece to welcome in those on a budget and to help make it a little easier to put together a nice collection of Spices. This is one of our best combos of the year, in part because with these two, the $2 price tag means big savings. But these two are also two of our best, simply because of how fun they are to use and how quick they are to bring smiles. Yes, as Cooks we are always having to heal the world, and at times are even called to save it, but along the way we do get to enjoy some pretty tasty food, don’t we? Northwoods Seasonings is one of our very best and most all-purpose blends, so tasty for potatoes, fish, vinegar and oil salads, chicken, baked vegetables, and steak and eggs, separately or together. Plus, Northwoods is so easy to use. Sprinkle on a little or a lot, it’s up to you, and either way you’re going to make those you cook for even happier that they have someone like you in their lives.   To see our Northwoods Seasoning click here: https://www.penzeys.com/…/northwoods-season…/c-24/p-423/pd-s Ground Red Chipotle is just plain fun. This lightly smoked, ground red Jalapeño Pepper is just so right in so many ways. Sure, the green Jalapeños have their place, but how the flavor changes as the Peppers mature from green to red is something special. Add in the light smoke and mellow heat and you have a Spice worthy of a place upon your shelf. But don’t let it sit there, add it to everything. Start simple, maybe an egg, or an avocado, or even a grilled cheese sandwich. Chipotle will open doors for you. Give it a try.

In our stores, and online at penzeys.com And as we said to those on our email list: These are tough times for those who love the American pursuit of ever greater equality. But in Republicans’ Lance Armstronging their response to all the charges they and their Supreme Court candidate are facing, it is clear their dance is coming to an end. When the facts are on your side, argue the facts. When the law is on your side, argue the law. When neither is on your side, bang your shoe on the table. From witnessing the events of this past week, this group is going to be in need of a good cobbler very soon. For Penzeys most popular Cobbler Recipe click here: https://www.penzeys.com/…/recipes/spiced-blackberry-cobbler/ Please sign up for our email list by clicking here:  http://spices.penzeys.com/coupon.html The thing about flat-out denying reality is that there’s no stepping back from it. There’s no negotiation afterwards that arrives at some mutually agreeable spot. Once you choose the Lance Armstrong approach, once you choose to attack those just doing their job by exposing your crimes, you’ve started a timer that, when it goes DING, means you are done. To go the full Lance is to understand that all there is ahead for you is lifetime suspension.  The leaders of the Republican Party are now on an end-of-days run. All there is left for them is to do as much damage as they can, to the benefit of their benefactors, before time runs out. November 6th is coming soon. Remember.  And in fairness to Mr. Armstrong, as much as he cheated and destroyed lives, he also tried to do some good. Not so much with the privileged guys we’ve seen this past week.  Thanks for being Cooks. You bring hope to the world, Bill Penzey bill@penzeys.com Thanks again.

      "Walla Walla County as your Ballots arrive at your home remember to turn your ballot over and look for my name, Kathy MULKERIN! Vote for Mulkerin for Clerk! I have been a Walla Walla community member since kindergarten. After graduating from Walla Walla High School, I earned my Bachelors of Arts degree, teaching certificate, and Master's degree before returning back to my community 14 years ago to raise my family. For the past 10 years, I have built a career in financial admin...istration, gaining valuable experience in finance, customer service, and administration. I decided to run for County Clerk for one reason: I believe the County Clerk’s office can work better for you. The first task I will take on is to extend open hours, which are currently 9am-4pm, without adding staff. By staggering shifts, the Clerk’s office can give more options for you to visit before or after work. The second will be to update the office’s technology to be on par with many clerk’s offices across the state. Currently, filing fees can only be paid by cash or check. I want to add credit/debit payment options, giving you flexibility in payment options. Additionally, though PDF forms of documents are on the state website, it can be difficult to navigate. By providing easy links to most-requested documents online, we can reduce customer requests in the office or over the phone. And finally, I will institute e-filing, which helps to streamline the filing process by reducing time and cost for both the consumer and the Clerk’s office. The third will be to prioritize Spanish skills with the next open position. Currently, 1 in 5 Walla Walla families speak Spanish at home, and I believe we can serve those families better in their native language. And finally, as your county clerk, I promise to be an understanding, friendly face when you come into the office. While the County Clerk’s office cannot give legal advice, they can ease the process and help you navigate the complex world of legal administration. When elected, I will work thoughtfully with the county commissioners and present them with the facts about costs and benefits for each upgrade. Most of the updates will not need an increase in the budget and the few that do will end up saving money, and time, in the long run. You deserve a County Clerk who will make your life easier. I am that person.\n",

For many animal lovers, news that Macau Canidrome was closing down was more than welcome.  The infamous Macau Canidrome is known as the place where greyhounds are shipped to race, waste away and ultimately die. In fact, according to one study, in just one year alone, 383 dogs were put down at the Macau race track.  If that was the death toll when the racetrack was running, it's no wonder why animal activists are worried about the 650 greyhounds that currently call the canidrome home.  They believe that before ,or by, the time the track shuts its doors all or most of the dogs could be killed — a virtual dog slaughter. All because the track has no more use for them.  Now they are asking the Macau government to step in and force the racetrack to hand the dogs over to a local animal rescue organization so they can be adopted out to loving families.  Add your name to the call to save the Macau 650. Tell the Macau government you want the dogs to be handed over to the local animal shelter.\n",

Prior to his election, Senator Feeney was Massachusetts State Director for Bernie Sanders and Legislative Director and Spokesperson for IBEW Local Union 2222. Please read the whole endorsement right here.          “I am proud to lend my enthusiastic support to Secretary Bill Galvin for re-election,” said Senator Feeney. “His passion to increase voter participation, coupled with decades of experience has resulted in online voter registration, early voting and pre-registration for young voters.  Additionally, Bill has championed automatic voter registration which will soon become law in the Commonwealth. Bill’s actions speak louder than his words, and his track-record as a forward thinking Secretary is clear and convincing. Secretary Galvin has worked tirelessly to bring transparency to a political system that, without his efforts, would be rigged only for those at the top.  Bill’s lifelong commitment to working families along with his dedication to promote more participation in the political process are values that are deeply rooted in his character.  Those are ideals that I share and feel must be at the core of the Secretary of our Commonwealth. I look forward to continuing to work with Secretary Galvin to shed light, add transparency and increase participation throughout every level of government.” .\n",

To turn back Nationalist Fascism, every American needed to do their all. So the V for Victory campaign was launched.  We, too, are now in the midst of a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. 11.8.16 was a shock, but the incredible effort of so many since has made the incredible turnaround of 11.6.18 possible. Be proud! But now comes the next two years which, if we are to turn back the Republican Party’s new Nationalism, are even more important than the last two. How do we stay focused with our eyes on the prize? Meet our new V pin, inspired by the V pins of 75 years ago when we last faced this very same challenge. Our V pin is small but surprisingly powerful. And through Sunday it is yours free with any purchase.  There’s also a Thanksgiving to be celebrated.

Abraham Lincoln made Thanksgiving our third national holiday after the 4th of July and Washington’s Birthday at the height of the Civil War as a reminder of the spirit of welcome to all that set this country in motion.

      "The New V Pin Is In! —Be prepared to Smile.  V-pin/Hot Chocolate/Thyme/Cajun free w $5 spend So WWII, a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. In Europe, everyone knew just what the war was and just what was at stake. In America, the war was not right outside our front door, it was somehow distant. To turn back Nationalist Fascism, every American needed to do their all. So the V for Victory campaign was launched.  We, too, are now in the midst of a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. 11.8.16 was a shock, but the incredible effort of so many since has made the incredible turnaround of 11.6.18 possible. Be proud! But now comes the next two years which, if we are to turn back the Republican Party’s new Nationalism, are even more important than the last two. How do we stay focused with our eyes on the prize? Meet our new V pin, inspired by the V pins of 75 years ago when we last faced this very same challenge. Our V pin is small but surprisingly powerful. And through Sunday it is yours free with any purchase.  There’s also a Thanksgiving to be celebrated. This Thursday it’s time to once again be reminded that what our country is, what makes it unique, is not anything Europeans brought with them, but instead was a gift given at great cost from the Wampanoag people. Abraham Lincoln made Thanksgiving our third national holiday after the 4th of July and Washington’s Birthday at the height of the Civil War as a reminder of the spirit of welcome to all that set this country in motion. This Thursday, please give thanks to our Native American community for teaching us what it means to be American. So our best Turkey Seasoning, the regularly $4.29 Bicentennial Rub, a Colonial mix of the Spices of the day, is just $1 along with regularly $2.95 Rubbed Sage for your stuffing.

With all this going on now’s a good time to visit us online at penzeys.com Sadly, Saturday won’t be a good day to visit our Philadelphia Store, as the building we are in will be closed because of actual Nazis actually marching right outside our actual front door. We aren’t the draw, it’s Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell across the street that they will be there for. Our next-door neighbor is the National Museum of American Jewish History. In the wake of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting not even a month ago, Saturday will be a tough day for them. Can we stop pretending that this president or the Republican Party that is now fully in his control are anything good people should still support? Please get your V pin.

      "A New Attack on the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Recently Senators Lindsey Graham, Bill Cassidy, Dean Heller, and Ron Johnson drafted an amendment to HR 1626 which was a bill passed by the Republican majority in Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). This proposed amendment could be voted on by the Senate as early as next week. It has already been opposed in a letter drafted and sent to members of the US Senate by 5 Republican and 5 Democratic ...Governors. The bill would repeal the authority of states to cover Medicaid expansion adults as of September 1st, 2017. It would also add an option for states to require work as a condition for Medicaid eligibility for non-elderly adults who are not disabled or pregnant. It would convert Medicaid as we know it to a block grant program where funds would be provided to the states; however, states would receive far less funding than they do today. It would also prohibit federal Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood clinics for at least 1 year. The amendment as drafted is extremely controversial since it would undermine the financial integrity of the Affordable Care Act, and it would result in millions of people no longer being able to afford their health insurance. It would eliminate the requirement for people to carry insurance, and it would also eliminate any subsidies to those who might otherwise qualify for financial subsidies under the ACA. Additionally, it would allow states to increase the cost of coverage for those with preexisting conditions, which could result in those persons no longer being able to afford to pay for health insurance. Last night, Jimmy Kimmel, a late night entertainer on ABC TV who has an infant son who was born with a congenital heart defect which required expensive surgery to survive, called Senator Bill Cassidy(R-Louisiana) out for being a sponsor of this amendment. Senator Cassidy had previously publicly stated that any amendment which he would introduce would have to pass what he called the “Jimmy Kimmel test,” which would mean that all children and infants would have the same opportunities that Kimmel’s son received. Last night, Kimmel expressed his disappointment that Cassidy had done just the reverse, and that the proposed amendment had failed in providing four essential components which he articulated as being necessary for any health insurance which are: 1. coverage for all; 2.no discrimination based on preexisting conditions; 3.lower premiums for middle-class families; and 4. no lifetime caps. Unfortunately, the proposed amendment fails the so-called “Jimmy Kimmel test” with a solid score of 0. Please contact your US senators and ask them to defeat this amendment.\n",

Kevin Brisson Music was kind enough to perform. But, it shouldn’t be a reality that you have to sell tickets to pay for your healthcare.

We, too, are now in the midst of a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. 11.8.16 was a shock, but the incredible effort of so many since has made the incredible turnaround of 11.6.18 possible.

With all this going on now’s a good time to visit us online at penzeys.com, or at all of our stores but one.  Sadly, Saturday won’t be a good day to visit our Philadelphia Store, as the building we are in will be closed because of actual Nazis actually marching right outside our actual front door. We aren’t the draw, it’s Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell across the street that they will be there for. Our next-door neighbor is the National Museum of American Jewish History. In the wake of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting not even a month ago, Saturday will be a tough day for them. Can we stop pretending that this president or the Republican Party that is now fully in his control are anything good people should still support? Please get your V pin.

No need to add any of these to your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. While I have you, if you are lucky enough to have $18 to spare, can you give thought to the people at the National Museum of American Jewish History next door to our Philadelphia Store? Hate has a way of wearing even the strongest of us down, and the amount of hate that’s been allowed to be directed towards America’s Jewish community in these last two years is staggering. Add in the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting that so many rushed to get behind us, and the thought of actual Nazis marching outside of their door is simply too much for any slice of the American pie to have to face alone. The museum has their donations page set up in $18 increments. A bunch of us visiting their page and leaving $18 to say someone they never met cares about them would mean a lot. You can find their donation page here: https://support.nmajh.org/annualfund And a special thanks to the kind people of Philadelphia. Since Friday’s email went out, the response from those who have no intention of sitting their kindness down simply because anger has shown up to march their streets is inspiring. Cooking really is caring about people. There’s reasons why America was born in Philadelphia. With the spirit of its people, rest assured it won’t be ending there anytime soon. America stands with you. Please be sure to get your V pin when you can. These are exciting times.

With all this going on now’s a good time to visit us online at penzeys.com, or at all of our stores but one.  Sadly, Saturday won’t be a good day to visit our Philadelphia Store, as the building we are in will be closed because of actual Nazis actually marching right outside our actual front door. We aren’t the draw, it’s Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell across the street that they will be there for. Our next-door neighbor is the National Museum of American Jewish History. In the wake of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting not even a month ago, Saturday will be a tough day for them. Can we stop pretending that this president or the Republican Party that is now fully in his control are anything good people should still support? Please get your V pin. In our stores or online there is no coupon or code needed for the free with purchase V pin, $1 Bicentennial and Rubbed Sage and the good deal on the Kind Heart Boxes. All those are automatic for everyone.  To get your in store coupons good for the free with $5 purchase $8.57 combined value Hot Chocolate French Thyme and Cajun Seasoning, please click this link: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html Online at penzeys.com after spending at least $5 enter 15653C in the apply code box at checkout for the Hot Chocolate, and then enter 20822C in the same box for the Thyme and Cajun. No need to add any of these to your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. While I have you, if you are lucky enough to have $18 to spare, can you give thought to the people at the National Museum of American Jewish History next door to our Philadelphia Store? Hate has a way of wearing even the strongest of us down, and the amount of hate that’s been allowed to be directed towards America’s Jewish community in these last two years is staggering. Add in the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting that so many rushed to get behind us, and the thought of actual Nazis marching outside of their door is simply too much for any slice of the American pie to have to face alone. The museum has their donations page set up in $18 increments. A bunch of us visiting their page and leaving $18 to say someone they never met cares about them would mean a lot. You can find their donation page here: https://support.nmajh.org/annualfund And a special thanks to the kind people of Philadelphia. Since Friday’s email went out, the response from those who have no intention of sitting their kindness down simply because anger has shown up to march their streets is inspiring. Cooking really is caring about people. There’s reasons why America was born in Philadelphia. With the spirit of its people, rest assured it won’t be ending there anytime soon. America stands with you. Please be sure to get your V pin when you can. These are exciting times. Thank you for your support, Bill bill@penzeys.com Liking this post, liking our FB page, and more importantly leaving a comment helps offset the extra hurdles our posts face due to our “political” belief that cooking is what happens when you care about people. And if you haven’t already, please sign up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking email list; that is the biggest help of all: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html Thanks once again, Bill\n",

      "California is on fire. Our eyes are burning and our lungs are choking with smoke. Here's our guide with 4 ways to respond - protecting ourselves &amp; our loved ones, serving our neighbors, aiding fire victims, and fighting for our air &amp; our future. Ready for one quick action now? bit.ly/needmask EN ESPAÑOL ABAJO. We need to be clear--the danger is not just from so-called “wild” fires, but a human-made disaster of climate change, poor planning, and an energy system driven by gree...d instead of our needs.  As much as we must take steps to protect ourselves, to wear masks, to purify our air, to stay indoors -- there’s no hiding from a world on fire. With climate change, the fire season has been growing unnaturally longer and fires have become more destructive. So what can we do? As Dr. Kari Nadeau from Stanford says: \"The answer is to stop the fires before they happen.\" Let's start. PROTECT YOURSELF Even if you’re healthy, this air can do lasting damage to your lungs and whole body as the toxins from burning cars, houses, and more reach your bloodstream. &gt;&gt;&gt;Stay inside with the windows closed. &gt;&gt;&gt;If you have to go outside, wear a well-fitting mask rated N/R/P95 or above and don’t exert yourself. You can even wear your mask like us, with #climatefire written on it for extra apocalyptic effect - and political impact. &gt;&gt;&gt;Get a HEPA-rated air purifier for inside areas, or make an air purifier with a box fan and HVAC filters for cheap (https://www.king5.com/…/this-diy-air-filter-f…/281-584346009 &gt;&gt;&gt;Additional resources here https://docs.google.com/…/1VzpW2SBiYLrTQrtO21pLp7lRoo…/edit… PROTECT YOUR NEIGHBORS ***Sign our petition to Bay Area cities and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District to treat this like a public health emergency*** https://actionnetwork.org/…/tell-bay-area-govt-treat-smoke-… Our governments should immediately: &gt;&gt;&gt;Provide masks to everyone who needs one. According to the latest article we’ve seen, Alameda County has given out only a few thousand masks. On the other hand, everyday people like the volunteer group Mask Oakland (venmo @maskoakland) have handed out 40,000 and counting. Our government needs to do more - public resources for public health!   &gt;&gt;&gt;Make air-filtered public spaces - including air-filtered libraries, senior centers, and shelters - available 24/7 for unsheltered neighbors and people who can't afford air purifiers to be indoors away from the bad air. We should shelter and house everyone who is living on the streets. &gt;&gt;&gt;Make sure our state, the Bay Area, and each city has an updated public health and emergency response plan for any future fires and smoke at this scale. People who work outside (including farmworkers &amp; incarcerated people fighting fires for us), unhoused people, people with lung conditions or disabilities, kids, seniors, and people of color and working-class people who are already disproportionately impacted by air pollution are hit the hardest. Let's take care of our neighbors. PROTECT OUR AIR AND OUR FUTURES &gt;&gt;&gt;Keep California’s oil in the ground. Tell California leaders, from Governor Brown and Governor-elect Gavin Newsom to Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols, to protect Californians’ health &amp; way of life by standing up to the oil industry that fuels climate-linked fires. http://brownslastchance.org/ &gt;&gt;&gt;Sign onto Communities for a Better Environment's letter to local governments. http://www.cbecal.org/climate-change-intensifies-injustice…/ &gt;&gt;&gt;Restore indigenous land management practices, including controlled burns (cultural burning) which for thousands of years have prevented the devastating fires at today’s scale and kept forests thriving: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pay your voluntary tax to the Sogorea Te Land Trust, a groundbreaking Bay Area indigenous land trust. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Tell Newsom and Nichols to expand indigenous-led land management programs.

Nuestros ojos arden y nuestros pulmones se están ahogando con el humo. Pero tenemos que ver a través del humo. Necesitamos estar clarxs: el peligro no se debe solo a los llamados \"wildfires\" en inglés, sino al desastre del cambio climático provocado por los humanos, una planificación deficiente y un sistema energético impulsado por la codicia en lugar de nuestras necesidades. Un artículo reciente del periódico The Chronicle cuestiona si quedarse adentro de la casa es suficiente para salvarnos del humo de los incendios. Entonces, ¿qué podemos hacer? Debemos tomar medidas para protegernos, usar máscaras, purificar nuestro aire, permanecer adentro. Pero no podemos escondernos de un mundo en llamas. La temporada de incendios se ha extendido de forma nada natural y los incendios se han vuelto más destructivos. Incluso cuando este humo se disipe, las condiciones para el siguiente incendio permanecerán:  la sequía, un clima caliente y vegetación muerta y seca por el cambio climático; una crisis de asequibilidad de la vivienda que obliga a las personas a vivir en zonas vulnerables; más el monopolio energético de PG&amp;E, que transmite la electricidad, derivada de combustibles fósiles, desde las centrales eléctricas masivas a través de áreas forestales en todo el estado. PG&amp;E es un culpable que sigue sin rendir cuentas. Como dice la Dra. Kari Nadeau de Stanford: \"La respuesta es detener los incendios antes de que ocurran\". Esto es una emergencia. Aquí compartimos cuatro formas de responder - más allá de protegernos a nosotrxs mismxs y a nuestrxs seres queridxs, también servir a nuestrxs vecinxs y ayudar a lxs sobrevivientes de incendios, y luchar por nuestro aire y nuestro futuro. PROTÉGETE A TI MISMX Incluso si estás sanx, este aire puede hacer daño a tus pulmones y todo el cuerpo, ya que las toxinas de los autos, las casas y de más que se quema alcanza tu sangre. &gt;&gt;&gt;Quédate adentro con las ventanas cerradas. &gt;&gt;&gt;Si tienes que salir afuera, use una máscara que te quede bien ajustada y que tenga una clasificación N / R / P95 o superior y no te esfuerces fisicamente. Incluso puedes usar tu máscara como nosotrxs, con #climatefire escrito para un efecto apocalíptico adicional, y un impacto político. &gt;&gt;&gt;Obtén un purificador de aire con clasificación HEPA para áreas interiores, o construye un purificador de aire con un ventilador de caja y filtros HVAC para hacerlo más barato.

Nuestros gobiernos deben inmediatamente: &gt;&gt;&gt;Proporcionar máscaras a todxs lxs que las necesiten. Según el último artículo que vimos, el Condado de Alameda ha entregado solo 5500 máscaras, y 5000 de ellas fueron donadas por una organización benéfica privada. Por otro lado, personas de la comunidad como el grupo de voluntarios Mask Oakland han entregado 8000 hasta ahora. Nuestro gobierno necesita hacer más: ¡Recursos públicos para la salud pública! &gt;&gt;&gt;Asegurar que los espacios públicos tengan aire filtrado, incluidas las bibliotecas, los centros para personas de la tercera edad y los refugios, que estén disponibles las 24 horas del día, los 7 días de la semana, para lxs vecinxs sin techo y las personas que no pueden pagar los purificadores de aire. &gt;&gt;&gt;Asegurar que cada persona en nuestra comunidad esté en lugares protegidos del aire dañino. Debemos albergar y alojar a todxs lxs que viven en las calles. &gt;&gt;&gt;Asegurar de que nuestro estado, el Área de la Bahía y cada ciudad tenga un plan actualizado de salud pública y respuesta de emergencia para futuros incendios y humo a este nivel.

      "The Jewish Federation of Greater Washington and JCRC of Greater Washington are horrified and heartbroken by the despicable murderous attack at the Tree Of Life - Or L'Simcha Congregation in #Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood that took place this morning during Shabbat services. Words are insufficient to convey our community's profound pain at the slaughter of innocent people who were worshiping with their community on the holy day of #Shabbat, a time that is a weekly re...minder to celebrate joy and peace.  It is particularly poignant that this savage attack took place in the midst of a Jewish baby naming, the welcoming of a new life with all of its hope and promise.  We stand in solidarity with the Pittsburgh Jewish community, and we mourn the loss of 11 innocent lives.  We also commend the bravery of Pittsburgh's first responders; current reports indicate that among the injured are several police officers. We are grateful for their courage, and our hearts ache for them and for their families.  We join together with so many fellow Americans in condemning the rising tide of white nationalism, racism and hatred directed at Jewish people and other vulnerable minorities in our country. An attack on one community is an attack on all Americans, and on the ideals our diverse nation stands for each day. No person should ever be in fear of assembling in their place of worship. Within our local community in Greater Washington, the JCRC and The Jewish Federation extend our gratitude to local law enforcement agencies, with whom we have been in close contact since this morning. Patrols and police presence have been increased at synagogues and other Jewish institutions in our region. We thank our partners in law enforcement for their support and their speedy response, and we will continue to work with them to coordinate institutional security for our community.  In the wake of such a devastating tragedy, grief, anger, and fear are all expected. This is especially so when the devastation occurs in a community so geographically close to ours; We know that many members of our Greater Washington Jewish community are themselves Pittsburgh natives and/or have many family and friends in Squirrel Hill. Please join us at Adas Israel Congregation - Washington, DC on Monday at 6:30 PM for an interfaith service and solidarity gathering, as we mourn the innocent lives lost, express our outrage and concern, and join in prayer as a community for the speedy recovery of those injured. Additional details may be found at jcouncil.org/solidarity. To meet the immediate security concerns in our community, Federation and its donors have committed a minimum of $100,000 towards emergency grants to synagogues and other Jewish organizations that are struggling to afford security. Donations to support this effort may be made to Federation’s Communal Security Fund to ensure that every community member feels safe in their places of gathering and worship. 100% of your gift will go towards meeting the immediate security needs of the synagogues and organizations serving our local community. Visit shalomdc.org/Communal-Security-Fund to support these efforts. Finally, as always, JSSA is available to help people individually or through our institutions and synagogues to cope with tragic events and to promote the resiliency of our community. If you would like to inquire about counseling for yourself or your family, please contact Scott Kreeger at (301) 610-8381 or inquire through JSSA’s intake department at (301) 816-2633. Ha’makom yenahem etkhem betokh she’ar avelei Tziyonvi’Yerushalayim. May the memories of the precious lives lost today be for a blessing, and may God console their families and friends among the other mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. We wish a speedy recovery, a refuah shleimah, to the injured.\n",

      "Recently, as we squeezed in dinner on a Monday night, my nine year old daughter reminded me of all of the sacrifices I have made as State's Attorney in Addison County. That Friday night, I had a phone call at 12:30 about an arrestee that took about forty five minutes. On Saturday morning I was awakened at 6:30 due to an untimely death. On Sunday, I spent much of the afternoon regarding the tragic death of Deane Rubright. That night I was dealing with a fatal drug overdose. Th...at's just a typical weekend. Often times I have miss planned events, like when one of my oldest friends, a guy I've known since childhood, flew home to Vermont from Oakland to celebrate his fiftieth birthday up in Isle La Motte. I was supposed to attend, but spent most of the day with the Vermont State Police in New  because a man shot his son in the back in Goshen. My friend returned to California. Never got to see him. Victims and perpetrators of crime in Addison aren't always local either. The work often takes me out of state, such as two sex assault cases I have prosecuted in the past couple years where the victims resided in southern New Hampshire. I met with these women in their homes, and spent many days of depositions on other occasions down near their seacoast homes. I even lived out of a hotel for a week in White River Junction to convict one of their attackers at trial. I don't write this to complain, because I would have it no other way. I write this to illustrate the level of commitment I have shown to ensuring justice for Addison County. This is just another way that I'm already working for you.

In Europe, everyone knew just what the war was and just what was at stake. In America, the war was not right outside our front door, it was somehow distant. To turn back Nationalist Fascism, every American needed to do their all. So the V for Victory campaign was launched.  We, too, are now in the midst of a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. 11.8.16 was a shock, but the incredible effort of so many since has made the incredible turnaround of 11.6.18 possible.

This Thursday it’s time to once again be reminded that what our country is, what makes it unique, is not anything Europeans brought with them, but instead was a gift given at great cost from the Wampanoag people. Abraham Lincoln made Thanksgiving our third national holiday after the 4th of July and Washington’s Birthday at the height of the Civil War as a reminder of the spirit of welcome to all that set this country in motion. This Thursday, please give thanks to our Native American community for teaching us what it means to be American. So our best Turkey Seasoning, the regularly $4.29 Bicentennial Rub, a Colonial mix of the Spices of the day, is just $1 along with regularly $2.95 Rubbed Sage for your stuffing. Plus $19.95 Kind Heart Boxes for just $12.50. To see Bicentennial Rub for turkey click this link: https://www.penzeys.com/online-cata…/bicentennial-rub/…/pd-s For Rubbed Sage please click here: https://www.penzeys.com/online-cat…/sage-rubbed/…/p-804/pd-s To see the cheerful Kind Hart Box please click on this link: https://www.penzeys.com/…/gift-pack-kind-…/c-24/p-1568/pd-gb Plus, we are on the verge of the holiday season, so we are doing our best to entice you in with a free $4.29 Penzeys Hot Chocolate and $4.28 combined value French Thyme and Cajun Seasoning. And where sometimes it’s your choice of the offers with $5, both with $10, this time a single $5 in spending gets you both offers and the very cool new V pin as well. With all this going on now’s a good time to visit us online at penzeys.com, or at all of our stores but one.  Sadly, Saturday won’t be a good day to visit our Philadelphia Store, as the building we are in will be closed because of actual Nazis actually marching right outside our actual front door. We aren’t the draw, it’s Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell across the street that they will be there for. Our next-door neighbor is the National Museum of American Jewish History. In the wake of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting not even a month ago, Saturday will be a tough day for them. Can we stop pretending that this president or the Republican Party that is now fully in his control are anything good people should still support? Please get your V pin. In our stores or online there is no coupon or code needed for the free with purchase V pin, $1 Bicentennial and Rubbed Sage and the good deal on the Kind Heart Boxes. All those are automatic for everyone.  To get your in store coupons good for the free with $5 purchase $8.57 combined value Hot Chocolate French Thyme and Cajun Seasoning, please click this link: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html Online at penzeys.com after spending at least $5 enter 15653C in the apply code box at checkout for the Hot Chocolate, and then enter 20822C in the same box for the Thyme and Cajun. No need to add any of these to your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. While I have you, if you are lucky enough to have $18 to spare, can you give thought to the people at the National Museum of American Jewish History next door to our Philadelphia Store? Hate has a way of wearing even the strongest of us down, and the amount of hate that’s been allowed to be directed towards America’s Jewish community in these last two years is staggering. Add in the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting that so many rushed to get behind us, and the thought of actual Nazis marching outside of their door is simply too much for any slice of the American pie to have to face alone. The museum has their donations page set up in $18 increments. A bunch of us visiting their page and leaving $18 to say someone they never met cares about them would mean a lot. You can find their donation page here: https://support.nmajh.org/annualfund And a special thanks to the kind people of Philadelphia. Since Friday’s email went out, the response from those who have no intention of sitting their kindness down simply because anger has shown up to march their streets is inspiring. Cooking really is caring about people. There’s reasons why America was born in Philadelphia. With the spirit of its people, rest assured it won’t be ending there anytime soon. America stands with you. Please be sure to get your V pin when you can. These are exciting times. Thank you for your support, Bill bill@penzeys.com Liking this post, liking our FB page, and more importantly leaving a comment helps offset the extra hurdles our posts face due to our “political” belief that cooking is what happens when you care about people. And if you haven’t already, please sign up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking email list; that is the biggest help of all: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html Thanks once again, Bill\n",

      "It appears to be intentional as to why things are the way they are in Oklahoma. The majority of state legislators, including my opponent Leslie Osborn and Glen Mulready (currently running for Insurance Commissioner), made the following law for wages. I thought you would want to read it for yourself. I would like to stress to you that all Oklahomans that need help, if they do not make enough in their wages to meet basic critical needs like FOOD, SHELTER AND HEALTH CARE, receiv...e tax dollars through state programs. People question why we have stagnant wages so how is putting an unnecessary burden on taxpayers to support sub par wages to protect poor business models okay to continue?  Oklahoma's current minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, the same as federal minimum wage. Oklahoma's minimum wage applies to any employer that grosses $100,000 or more a year, OR hires ten or more employees. Oklahoma does not have a unique minimum wage, and instead adopts the Federal Minimum Wage by reference. Oklahoma sets a special minimum wage of $2.00 per hour for work not covered by the Federal Minimum Wage, including full time students. Any employees under the age of 22 who are enrolled as full-time students are exempt from Oklahoma's minimum wage law (but the special minimum wage of $2.00 per hour still applies).  Additional exempt employees include farm and ranch workers, maids, government employees, railroad workers, temporary part-time employees, feed store employees, and deputy sheriffs. Exempt means they are unprotected because they are not required to be paid the minimum wage. Additional minimum wage statutes allow Oklahoma employers to deduct the cost of uniforms from their employee's wages. If employers fail to pay the legal minimum wage to an employee, they could be liable to pay up to double the amount of wages owed to the employee. Oklahoma employers may not pay you under $7.25 per hour unless you or your occupation are specifically exempt from the minimum wage under state or federal law. Again, the burden of a business that only prospers by sacrificing the well being of its employees should not be placed upon the shoulders of Oklahoma wage earners.\n",

      "The New V Pin Is In! —Be prepared to Smile.  V-pin/Hot Chocolate/Thyme/Cajun free w $5 spend So WWII, a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. In Europe, everyone knew just what the war was and just what was at stake. In America, the war was not right outside our front door, it was somehow distant. To turn back Nationalist Fascism, every American needed to do their all. So the V for Victory campaign was launched.  We, too, are now in the midst of a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. 11.8.16 was a shock, but the incredible effort of so many since has made the incredible turnaround of 11.6.18 possible. Be proud! But now comes the next two years which, if we are to turn back the Republican Party’s new Nationalism, are even more important than the last two. How do we stay focused with our eyes on the prize? Meet our new V pin, inspired by the V pins of 75 years ago when we last faced this very same challenge. Our V pin is small but surprisingly powerful. And through Sunday it is yours free with any purchase.  There’s also a Thanksgiving to be celebrated. This Thursday it’s time to once again be reminded that what our country is, what makes it unique, is not anything Europeans brought with them, but instead was a gift given at great cost from the Wampanoag people. Abraham Lincoln made Thanksgiving our third national holiday after the 4th of July and Washington’s Birthday at the height of the Civil War as a reminder of the spirit of welcome to all that set this country in motion. This Thursday, please give thanks to our Native American community for teaching us what it means to be American. So our best Turkey Seasoning, the regularly $4.29 Bicentennial Rub, a Colonial mix of the Spices of the day, is just $1 along with regularly $2.95 Rubbed Sage for your stuffing.

With all this going on now’s a good time to visit us online at penzeys.com Sadly, Saturday won’t be a good day to visit our Philadelphia Store, as the building we are in will be closed because of actual Nazis actually marching right outside our actual front door. We aren’t the draw, it’s Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell across the street that they will be there for. Our next-door neighbor is the National Museum of American Jewish History. In the wake of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting not even a month ago, Saturday will be a tough day for them.

      "KARL ROVE THINKS CHINA IS A RACE Attached is a link to a video of Karl Rove. He gets paid to say things like he says here. Unfortunately, Karl is not sensical or truthful.   Here is what Karl Rove said in reaction to my calling Elaine Chao’s family “China People” in response to why I am concerned about Mitch McConnell possibly having a conflict of interest when considering legislation effecting U.S. and China relations. The video of his comments is contrasted here with what I... believe to be the truth: https://www.donblankenship.com/…/KARL-ROVE-THINKS-CHINA-IS-… 1).  He says I am a bigot and a moron.    First, it should be clear to Mr. Rove that my calling Elaine Chao a China Person, which is what he claims to be so upset about, is not a bigoted comment. China is not a race; it is a country. He tries to act as if the fact that Elaine’s father (James) was born in Taiwan is a basis for saying that Elaine is not a China Person. He comments that Taiwan broke away from China in 1949. He fails to point out that this means that Elaine’s father, James, was born in Communist China and spent his formative years there after he was born in 1927. As Karl points out, in 1927 Taiwan was a part of Communist China. However, none of this is relevant to the point I was making when I referred to the Chao’s as China People. Again, China is a country and people born there can be rightfully referred to as China People just like West Virginia born people are sometimes referred to as Appalachian or West Virginia People.   Second, referring to someone with my accomplishments in life as a “moron” is a little worse than referring to a family from China as China People. I referred to the Chao’s as China people not because of their heritage but because today they have very direct financial and social ties to the China communist government. My words ‘China Person’ were specifically directed at whether Mr. McConnell and his in-laws, the Chao’s, might have a conflict of interest given that the Chao’s, and by marriage Mitch, make a fortune shipping goods to and from China and given that Mitch is controlling the Senate agenda. Senator McConnell’s Senate Majority position could at some point have a significant impact on U.S.-China relations and resultantly on the Chao business, and therefore Mitch himself. In addition, Elaine (Mitch’s wife) is a member of the Trump Cabinet and has regular access to President Trump.   Some final points on Mitch’s bigot and moron comments is that Karl Rove is a paid propagandist and is himself conflicted. Karl makes his money as a result of decisions made by Mitch McConnell who controls the spending of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. In other words, Mr. Rove is conflicted and made his comments about me to prevent a Republican from getting into the Senate that had vowed to oppose Mitch continuing to be the Senate Majority Leader and continuing to support Karl. Additionally, Mitch’s orchestration of such an extreme reaction to my comments are evidence that he is in fact conflicted when it comes to decisions regarding China which is now the second largest economy and the second most powerful military in the world. If those points are not enough to convince you that my comments were not racist but were rather intended to bring attention to a significant potential conflict of interest consider this; Angela Chao was on the China State Shipbuilding Company board which builds China Naval Warships and whose goal is to make the China Navy the best in the world. Angela is also on the board of the Bank of China which will be very much impacted by Trump and U.S. trade and currency decisions.     I guess the question is whether it would be racist for Karl or Mitch to call me a coal person or a West Virginia person. Personally I do not think so given that people know I have fought for the safety of coal miners and coal interests most of my life and that I have not been on any China government owned boards who are attempting to be better than us militarily and economically, not many Americans have—in fact not a single one other than Angela Chao.   2). Karl also says I was in charge where 29 miners died and that I went to prison for it.   It is not necessary to belabor the point in this post. Suffice it to say that if I had been in charge of the mine airflow it would never have been cut in half. No one at Massey would have ever ventilated the mine the way that MSHA ordered that it be ventilated. Additionally, were I not in favor of draining the Washington Swamp Mr. Rove would be using my treatment by the Obama Department of Justice as evidence of how corrupt they were. He would be saying “look they put this guy Blankenship, who did more for mine safety than anyone ever, in prison for a misdemeanor. A misdemeanor that does not even exist and that no one had ever been told was a civil violation, let alone a crime”. Just think, Mr. Rove would have been telling the truth rather than lying on behalf of the Swamp and McConnell. 3). Rove says I do not live in West Virginia and cannot even vote for myself. Karl knows he is lying. Many Americans have multiple homes. You can choose where you want to live. Oddly enough the government confined me pending trial to what they called my “home in West Virginia”.  And I voted in West Virginia.  But despite Karl’s comments I refuse to call him a “moron”.   4).  Karl also says the Chao’s create jobs in America.   Karl may be right as I do not know. However, they buy these huge ships the family owns from China and that does not create jobs in America.   5). Karl also said I could not win the general election if I won the primary.    Obviously Karl still thinks he can predict elections even though he said Trump had no chance of winning.  But I still refuse to call him a “moron”. 6). Karl also says “tens of millions of dollars” . . . He then abruptly stops. What Karl is likely starting to say there is that I pointed out that Mitch’s father-in-law James Chao gave Mitch’s wife Elaine $40 million dollars prior to Mitch’s last election campaign. Yea, its legal. Dad gave Elaine $40 million and once in the McConnell family it was available to Mitch for his campaign spending. Now that creates a real conflict of interest. West Virginia People that know me know that I am not a racist nor a moron. Hopefully they also know, that I did not know, that Karl Rove thought China was a race before he said so. Again I still refuse to call Mr. Rove a moron.   - Don Blankenship\n",

We, too, are now in the midst of a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. 11.8.16 was a shock, but the incredible effort of so many since has made the incredible turnaround of 11.6.18 possible. Be proud! But now comes the next two years which, if we are to turn back the Republican Party’s new Nationalism, are even more important than the last two. How do we stay focused with our eyes on the prize? Meet our new V pin, inspired by the V pins of 75 years ago when we last faced this very same challenge. Our V pin is small but surprisingly powerful. And through Sunday it is yours free with any purchase.  There’s also a Thanksgiving to be celebrated. This Thursday it’s time to once again be reminded that what our country is, what makes it unique, is not anything Europeans brought with them, but instead was a gift given at great cost from the Wampanoag people. Abraham Lincoln made Thanksgiving our third national holiday after the 4th of July and Washington’s Birthday at the height of the Civil War as a reminder of the spirit of welcome to all that set this country in motion. This Thursday, please give thanks to our Native American community for teaching us what it means to be American. So our best Turkey Seasoning, the regularly $4.29 Bicentennial Rub, a Colonial mix of the Spices of the day, is just $1 along with regularly $2.95 Rubbed Sage for your stuffing. Plus $19.95 Kind Heart Boxes for just $12.50. To see Bicentennial Rub for turkey click this link: https://www.penzeys.com/online-cata…/bicentennial-rub/…/pd-s For Rubbed Sage please click here: https://www.penzeys.com/online-cat…/sage-rubbed/…/p-804/pd-s To see the cheerful Kind Hart Box please click on this link: https://www.penzeys.com/…/gift-pack-kind-…/c-24/p-1568/pd-gb Plus, we are on the verge of the holiday season, so we are doing our best to entice you in with a free $4.29 Penzeys Hot Chocolate and $4.28 combined value French Thyme and Cajun Seasoning. And where sometimes it’s your choice of the offers with $5, both with $10, this time a single $5 in spending gets you both offers and the very cool new V pin as well. With all this going on now’s a good time to visit us online at penzeys.com, or at all of our stores but one.  Sadly, Saturday won’t be a good day to visit our Philadelphia Store, as the building we are in will be closed because of actual Nazis actually marching right outside our actual front door. We aren’t the draw, it’s Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell across the street that they will be there for. Our next-door neighbor is the National Museum of American Jewish History. In the wake of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting not even a month ago, Saturday will be a tough day for them. Can we stop pretending that this president or the Republican Party that is now fully in his control are anything good people should still support? Please get your V pin. In our stores or online there is no coupon or code needed for the free with purchase V pin, $1 Bicentennial and Rubbed Sage and the good deal on the Kind Heart Boxes. All those are automatic for everyone.  To get your in store coupons good for the free with $5 purchase $8.57 combined value Hot Chocolate French Thyme and Cajun Seasoning, please click this link: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html Online at penzeys.com after spending at least $5 enter 15653C in the apply code box at checkout for the Hot Chocolate, and then enter 20822C in the same box for the Thyme and Cajun. No need to add any of these to your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. While I have you, if you are lucky enough to have $18 to spare, can you give thought to the people at the National Museum of American Jewish History next door to our Philadelphia Store? Hate has a way of wearing even the strongest of us down, and the amount of hate that’s been allowed to be directed towards America’s Jewish community in these last two years is staggering. Add in the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting that so many rushed to get behind us, and the thought of actual Nazis marching outside of their door is simply too much for any slice of the American pie to have to face alone. The museum has their donations page set up in $18 increments. A bunch of us visiting their page and leaving $18 to say someone they never met cares about them would mean a lot. You can find their donation page here: https://support.nmajh.org/annualfund And a special thanks to the kind people of Philadelphia. Since Friday’s email went out, the response from those who have no intention of sitting their kindness down simply because anger has shown up to march their streets is inspiring. Cooking really is caring about people. There’s reasons why America was born in Philadelphia. With the spirit of its people, rest assured it won’t be ending there anytime soon. America stands with you. Please be sure to get your V pin when you can. These are exciting times. Thank you for your support, Bill bill@penzeys.com Liking this post, liking our FB page, and more importantly leaving a comment helps offset the extra hurdles our posts face due to our “political” belief that cooking is what happens when you care about people.

      "Mark your calendars!!  Nov 27th is #GivingTuesday and Facebook will match donations up to $7 million dollars. AND  the easiest way to participate is for you to start your own fundraiser for AWN Network right here from our page.  Please feel free to use our #GivingTuesday graphic for your posts, as well as any of the following information about the work we're accomplishing at AWN Network!! Advocacy &amp; Activism: AWN seeks to develop informational materials in several areas to educate the public about the Autistic experience and to provide support and advocacy to these communities. AWN Network’s Committee on Autism &amp; Ethnicity aims to educate the public about the impact of race and culture on our Autistic identities. The committee published the anthology: “All the Weight of our Dreams: on living racialized autism.” In addition, the committee runs a grant program for Autistic people of color. Divergent: when disability &amp; feminism collide is an initiative of AWN Network which seeks to explore the impact of sexism and ableism in disabled and nondisabled communities.  Divergent is run exclusively by disabled people of varying identities and disabilities. The committee plans to host a Symposium and publish an anthology of discussions from the one day conference. AWN Network has an ongoing Health Provider Survey with a linked database listing intimate care providers. These providers offer sensory friendly and accessible health care.  In our work to develop more inclusive and accessible communities and opportunities, AWN Network focuses on challenging societal attitudes about the worth of disabled lives. Autistic Women &amp; Nonbinary Network welcomes all women, both transgender and cisgender, non-binary and genderqueer people, Two-Spirit people, people who have at any time identified as women or girls, and all other people of marginalized genders or of no gender. AWN recognizes and affirms all people’s gender identities and expressions, as well as choices about disclosure, transition, and going stealth. AWN Network’s major accomplishments include:    • Two Publications: ** The Girls Anthology is a compilation of twenty (20) essays by autistic people to communicate to parents of autistic girls what their daughters are going through during various stages of their growth and maturity.   “What Every Autistic Girl Wishes Her Parents Knew” is the book that many adults on the autistic spectrum wish their parents would have had access to when they were growing up. In this first girls anthology book release from AWN Network, the autistic contributors write with honesty and generosity about the emotional needs, sensitivity, and vibrancy of autistic girls.  Containing thoughtful and practical encouragement and support for parents and compiled from the acquired wisdom and experience of autistic individuals, parents are finding this collection of essays an invaluable resource for supporting their autistic daughters in developing strength, trust and confidence in themselves, and in the world. ** All the Weight of Our Dreams: on living racialized autism, is a collection of essays, poetry, fiction, and art from over fifty (50) autistics of color on the experience of living in a world being autistic and non-white. An excerpt from their webpage describes the anthology project in this way: “For those of us who are autistic and racialized, we often struggle to find representation in mass media, academic work about autism or race, and the activist and advocacy movements that focus on autism, neurodiversity, disability rights, or racial justice. Most autism and autistic organizations, publications about autism, and broader neurodiversity campaigns are predominantly white. Yet disabled Black and Brown students are most likely to be impacted by the school to prison pipeline; the vast majority of U.S. prisoners are disabled and Black or Brown; racialized people are a global majority (which means that autistic people of color far outnumber white autistic people in the world); and the combined impact of race and disability severely increase likelihood for hate crimes, police violence, all other forms of abuse, and repeated retraumatization.  Our stories matter and must be told. We hope that this collection will not only speak sharply against our constant erasure and invisibility as (at least) doubly impacted but will also provide solace and familiarity for our own out there waiting for stories like theirs to be told.” * The first of its kind Health Care Survey and Resource List. This database lists gynecologists (and other intimate care providers) who offer accessible and sensory-considerate health care to women and non-binary people on the autism spectrum.  * Since 2009, production of more than 200 original articles have been published on AWN Network’s blog. * Social Meetup Groups: Social Meetup Groups donations will help us come together for planned activities, outings and social meetups at a variety of venues such as coffee shops, restaurants, movie nights, arts &amp; crafts days and more.   Donations will also go toward transportation vouchers.  Examples include gas vouchers for those in need of financial assistance or to help those in rural areas where public transportation is limited and inaccessible. * Networking &amp; Web Development: AWN provides an interactive website to educate, empower and provide support. Donations will pay for costs associated with all web development, maintenance and security upgrades in order to provide online resources to our community. Your support will also help AWN Network educate and advocate via various social media platforms. Thank you so very much for your support!!

      "The New V Pin Is In! —Be prepared to Smile.  V-pin/Hot Chocolate/Thyme/Cajun free w $5 spend So WWII, a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. In Europe, everyone knew just what the war was and just what was at stake. In America, the war was not right outside our front door, it was somehow distant. To turn back Nationalist Fascism, every American needed to do their all. So the V for Victory campaign was launched.  We, too, are now in the midst of a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. 11.8.16 was a shock, but the incredible effort of so many since has made the incredible turnaround of 11.6.18 possible. Be proud! But now comes the next two years which, if we are to turn back the Republican Party’s new Nationalism, are even more important than the last two. How do we stay focused with our eyes on the prize? Meet our new V pin, inspired by the V pins of 75 years ago when we last faced this very same challenge. Our V pin is small but surprisingly powerful. And through Sunday it is yours free with any purchase.  There’s also a Thanksgiving to be celebrated. This Thursday it’s time to once again be reminded that what our country is, what makes it unique, is not anything Europeans brought with them, but instead was a gift given at great cost from the Wampanoag people. Abraham Lincoln made Thanksgiving our third national holiday after the 4th of July and Washington’s Birthday at the height of the Civil War as a reminder of the spirit of welcome to all that set this country in motion. This Thursday, please give thanks to our Native American community for teaching us what it means to be American. So our best Turkey Seasoning, the regularly $4.29 Bicentennial Rub, a Colonial mix of the Spices of the day, is just $1 along with regularly $2.95 Rubbed Sage for your stuffing. Plus $19.95 Kind Heart Boxes for just $12.50. To see Bicentennial Rub for turkey click this link: https://www.penzeys.com/online-cata…/bicentennial-rub/…/pd-s For Rubbed Sage please click here: https://www.penzeys.com/online-cat…/sage-rubbed/…/p-804/pd-s To see the cheerful Kind Hart Box please click on this link: https://www.penzeys.com/…/gift-pack-kind-…/c-24/p-1568/pd-gb Plus, we are on the verge of the holiday season, so we are doing our best to entice you in with a free $4.29 Penzeys Hot Chocolate and $4.28 combined value French Thyme and Cajun Seasoning. And where sometimes it’s your choice of the offers with $5, both with $10, this time a single $5 in spending gets you both offers and the very cool new V pin as well. With all this going on now’s a good time to visit us online at penzeys.com, or at all of our stores but one.  Sadly, Saturday won’t be a good day to visit our Philadelphia Store, as the building we are in will be closed because of actual Nazis actually marching right outside our actual front door. We aren’t the draw, it’s Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell across the street that they will be there for. Our next-door neighbor is the National Museum of American Jewish History. In the wake of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting not even a month ago, Saturday will be a tough day for them. Can we stop pretending that this president or the Republican Party that is now fully in his control are anything good people should still support? Please get your V pin. In our stores or online there is no coupon or code needed for the free with purchase V pin, $1 Bicentennial and Rubbed Sage and the good deal on the Kind Heart Boxes. All those are automatic for everyone.  To get your in store coupons good for the free with $5 purchase $8.57 combined value Hot Chocolate French Thyme and Cajun Seasoning, please click this link: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html Online at penzeys.com after spending at least $5 enter 15653C in the apply code box at checkout for the Hot Chocolate, and then enter 20822C in the same box for the Thyme and Cajun. No need to add any of these to your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. While I have you, if you are lucky enough to have $18 to spare, can you give thought to the people at the National Museum of American Jewish History next door to our Philadelphia Store? Hate has a way of wearing even the strongest of us down, and the amount of hate that’s been allowed to be directed towards America’s Jewish community in these last two years is staggering. Add in the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting that so many rushed to get behind us, and the thought of actual Nazis marching outside of their door is simply too much for any slice of the American pie to have to face alone. The museum has their donations page set up in $18 increments. A bunch of us visiting their page and leaving $18 to say someone they never met cares about them would mean a lot. You can find their donation page here: https://support.nmajh.org/annualfund And a special thanks to the kind people of Philadelphia. Since Friday’s email went out, the response from those who have no intention of sitting their kindness down simply because anger has shown up to march their streets is inspiring. Cooking really is caring about people. There’s reasons why America was born in Philadelphia. With the spirit of its people, rest assured it won’t be ending there anytime soon. America stands with you. Please be sure to get your V pin when you can. These are exciting times. Thank you for your support, Bill bill@penzeys.com Liking this post, liking our FB page, and more importantly leaving a comment helps offset the extra hurdles our posts face due to our “political” belief that cooking is what happens when you care about people. And if you haven’t already, please sign up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking email list; that is the biggest help of all: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html Thanks once again, Bill\n",

You can find their donation page here: https://support.nmajh.org/annualfund And a special thanks to the kind people of Philadelphia. Since Friday’s email went out, the response from those who have no intention of sitting their kindness down simply because anger has shown up to march their streets is inspiring. Cooking really is caring about people. There’s reasons why America was born in Philadelphia. With the spirit of its people, rest assured it won’t be ending there anytime soon. America stands with you. Please be sure to get your V pin when you can. These are exciting times.

      "The New V Pin Is In! —Be prepared to Smile.  V-pin/Hot Chocolate/Thyme/Cajun free w $5 spend So WWII, a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. In Europe, everyone knew just what the war was and just what was at stake. In America, the war was not right outside our front door, it was somehow distant. To turn back Nationalist Fascism, every American needed to do their all. So the V for Victory campaign was launched.  We, too, are now in the midst of a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. 11.8.16 was a shock, but the incredible effort of so many since has made the incredible turnaround of 11.6.18 possible. Be proud! But now comes the next two years which, if we are to turn back the Republican Party’s new Nationalism, are even more important than the last two. How do we stay focused with our eyes on the prize? Meet our new V pin, inspired by the V pins of 75 years ago when we last faced this very same challenge. Our V pin is small but surprisingly powerful. And through Sunday it is yours free with any purchase.  There’s also a Thanksgiving to be celebrated. This Thursday it’s time to once again be reminded that what our country is, what makes it unique, is not anything Europeans brought with them, but instead was a gift given at great cost from the Wampanoag people. Abraham Lincoln made Thanksgiving our third national holiday after the 4th of July and Washington’s Birthday at the height of the Civil War as a reminder of the spirit of welcome to all that set this country in motion. This Thursday, please give thanks to our Native American community for teaching us what it means to be American. So our best Turkey Seasoning, the regularly $4.29 Bicentennial Rub, a Colonial mix of the Spices of the day, is just $1 along with regularly $2.95 Rubbed Sage for your stuffing. Plus $19.95 Kind Heart Boxes for just $12.50.

And where sometimes it’s your choice of the offers with $5, both with $10, this time a single $5 in spending gets you both offers and the very cool new V pin as well. With all this going on now’s a good time to visit us online at penzeys.com, or at all of our stores but one.  Sadly, Saturday won’t be a good day to visit our Philadelphia Store, as the building we are in will be closed because of actual Nazis actually marching right outside our actual front door. We aren’t the draw, it’s Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell across the street that they will be there for. Our next-door neighbor is the National Museum of American Jewish History. In the wake of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting not even a month ago, Saturday will be a tough day for them. Can we stop pretending that this president or the Republican Party that is now fully in his control are anything good people should still support? Please get your V pin.

      "Immigrants play a vital role in the life of the United States.  As a nation of immigrants, it is clear that no matter where immigrants come from, they bring with them new ideas and opportunity.  Immigration serves to benefit our country. I am appalled that under President Trump's leadership the United States has become increasingly hostile to immigrants.  Under his orders we have seen disgusting displays of inhumanity towards people seeking refuge or a better life in America....  I am committed to ending vicious and inhumane immigration policies, which must have no place in the United States. We must fix our broken immigration system, and I continue to actively work on legislation that would ensure immigrants are treated humanely, have access to legal resources, and have certain protections awarded to them, particularly for refugees.  I have recently partnered with Rep. Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) on H.R. 6361 to terminate ICE and to restructure our immigration enforcement system in a humane and holistic way.  Additionally, I have co-sponsored legislation to keep families together and to protect immigrant children from being cruelly separated from their parents.  I am a strong supporter of DACA and have co-sponsored legislation that would ensure that DACA protections are continued.  Finally, I am very proud to have sponsored H.R. 3923, the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act of 2017. I continue to fervently work with my colleagues on immigration reform legislation, and I am confident that with a Democratic majority in Congress we will be able to pass vital reforms to make our immigration system work for everyone and allow the United States to grow and thrive with help from the best and brightest from around the world.   http://thehill.com/…/396712-dems-introduce-bill-to-eliminat…\n",

      "The New V Pin Is In! —Be prepared to Smile.  V-pin/Hot Chocolate/Thyme/Cajun free w $5 spend So WWII, a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. In Europe, everyone knew just what the war was and just what was at stake. In America, the war was not right outside our front door, it was somehow distant. To turn back Nationalist Fascism, every American needed to do their all. So the V for Victory campaign was launched.  We, too, are now in the midst of a four-year struggle against everything America was created to defend against. 11.8.16 was a shock, but the incredible effort of so many since has made the incredible turnaround of 11.6.18 possible. Be proud! But now comes the next two years which, if we are to turn back the Republican Party’s new Nationalism, are even more important than the last two. How do we stay focused with our eyes on the prize? Meet our new V pin, inspired by the V pins of 75 years ago when we last faced this very same challenge. Our V pin is small but surprisingly powerful. And through Sunday it is yours free with any purchase.  There’s also a Thanksgiving to be celebrated. This Thursday it’s time to once again be reminded that what our country is, what makes it unique, is not anything Europeans brought with them, but instead was a gift given at great cost from the Wampanoag people. Abraham Lincoln made Thanksgiving our third national holiday after the 4th of July and Washington’s Birthday at the height of the Civil War as a reminder of the spirit of welcome to all that set this country in motion. This Thursday, please give thanks to our Native American community for teaching us what it means to be American. So our best Turkey Seasoning, the regularly $4.29 Bicentennial Rub, a Colonial mix of the Spices of the day, is just $1 along with regularly $2.95 Rubbed Sage for your stuffing. Plus $19.95 Kind Heart Boxes for just $12.50. To see Bicentennial Rub for turkey click this link: https://www.penzeys.com/online-cata…/bicentennial-rub/…/pd-s For Rubbed Sage please click here: https://www.penzeys.com/online-cat…/sage-rubbed/…/p-804/pd-s To see the cheerful Kind Hart Box please click on this link: https://www.penzeys.com/…/gift-pack-kind-…/c-24/p-1568/pd-gb Plus, we are on the verge of the holiday season, so we are doing our best to entice you in with a free $4.29 Penzeys Hot Chocolate and $4.28 combined value French Thyme and Cajun Seasoning. And where sometimes it’s your choice of the offers with $5, both with $10, this time a single $5 in spending gets you both offers and the very cool new V pin as well. With all this going on now’s a good time to visit us online at penzeys.com, or at all of our stores but one.  Sadly, Saturday won’t be a good day to visit our Philadelphia Store, as the building we are in will be closed because of actual Nazis actually marching right outside our actual front door. We aren’t the draw, it’s Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell across the street that they will be there for. Our next-door neighbor is the National Museum of American Jewish History. In the wake of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting not even a month ago, Saturday will be a tough day for them. Can we stop pretending that this president or the Republican Party that is now fully in his control are anything good people should still support? Please get your V pin. In our stores or online there is no coupon or code needed for the free with purchase V pin, $1 Bicentennial and Rubbed Sage and the good deal on the Kind Heart Boxes. All those are automatic for everyone.  To get your in store coupons good for the free with $5 purchase $8.57 combined value Hot Chocolate French Thyme and Cajun Seasoning, please click this link: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html Online at penzeys.com after spending at least $5 enter 15653C in the apply code box at checkout for the Hot Chocolate, and then enter 20822C in the same box for the Thyme and Cajun. No need to add any of these to your basket, the codes do that for you and for free. While I have you, if you are lucky enough to have $18 to spare, can you give thought to the people at the National Museum of American Jewish History next door to our Philadelphia Store? Hate has a way of wearing even the strongest of us down, and the amount of hate that’s been allowed to be directed towards America’s Jewish community in these last two years is staggering. Add in the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting that so many rushed to get behind us, and the thought of actual Nazis marching outside of their door is simply too much for any slice of the American pie to have to face alone. The museum has their donations page set up in $18 increments. A bunch of us visiting their page and leaving $18 to say someone they never met cares about them would mean a lot. You can find their donation page here: https://support.nmajh.org/annualfund And a special thanks to the kind people of Philadelphia. Since Friday’s email went out, the response from those who have no intention of sitting their kindness down simply because anger has shown up to march their streets is inspiring. Cooking really is caring about people. There’s reasons why America was born in Philadelphia. With the spirit of its people, rest assured it won’t be ending there anytime soon. America stands with you. Please be sure to get your V pin when you can. These are exciting times. Thank you for your support, Bill bill@penzeys.com Liking this post, liking our FB page, and more importantly leaving a comment helps offset the extra hurdles our posts face due to our “political” belief that cooking is what happens when you care about people.

      "Free $22.95 Salt &amp; Pepper Time Box w $1 purchase—Mueller Report Not a Nothing Burger Recipe! — It’s Salt &amp; Pepper time, time to admit what’s clearly on the table before us. In the wake of the Mueller report (even the doctored 4-page Attorney General spin version), the reality we must face going is that our president is a Crook. And the problem for America is that he’s not just a run-of-the-mill crook, but instead one quite skilled at directing others to commit his crimes whil...e pretending his innocence.   The research says people with cooking in their lives go on to better futures, but the research so far doesn’t quite know why. My thought is that a life surrounded with the goodness that is cooking leaves us better able to see paths that lead towards positive outcomes while avoiding the negative ones. In many ways our time around the dinner table leaves us better able to tell right from wrong. Yes, as Lincoln said, we can all be fooled some of the time, but Cooks, time and again, lead the way into the can’t be fooled all the time category. Take a Cook’s-eye look at the president’s actual words to the Russians about his opponent’s emails at a point where his campaign already had multiple contacts with the Russians expressing their desire to help make his election a reality. Does he actually say I’m entering into an agreement to commit election interference? No, he is too skilled for that, but it is those very skills that betrays his true nature. What should we make of his actions? As the Voice Of Cooking, let us be the first to say: Crook-Crooked-Crookedly-Crook.  Please sign up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking email list here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html And now that Crook-Crooked-Crookedly-Crook has been said, it’s time to get on to redoubling our efforts to make sure every possible American turns out to vote 11.3.20. As we’ve learned before, a good message travels far, but a good message tied to a really good free offer knows no limits. So through Saturday at midnight, $22.95 Salt &amp; Pepper Time gift boxes free with any purchase. These boxes contain full half-cup-sized jars of our tasty Seasoned Salt and World’s Best Penzeys Pepper. And of course for each jar of Penzeys Pepper sold or given in an offer like this another is given to those who work to feed those in need.  In addition to the two half-cup jars, the Salt &amp; Pepper Time contains our new Embrace Hope refrigerator/bumper magnet, tip cards, Victory pin and three I Will Vote 11.3.20 Heart stickers—one to keep two to share. This really is a $22.95 value free with any purchase. You can see the Salt &amp; Pepper Time box here: https://www.penzeys.com/…/salt-pepper-tim…/c-24/p-3189/pd-gb And please check out our Mueller Report Something Burger with its No Secrets Sauce so worth sharing. You can find the recipe here: https://www.penzeys.com/…/mueller-something-burger-with-no…/ At a hearty 1/3 of a pound, this is no Nothing Burger by any means. In addition to our Seasoned Salt and Penzeys Pepper, partially inspired by the commenter from our last post, “Flash Gorski,” this recipe calls for a dollop of sour cream seasoned with Marjoram and/or our tasty Krakow Nights Seasoning as a reminder that selling out our allies to please dictators is not a victimless crime. We have both on sale in 1/4-cup jars for just $1 each. And yes, just the purchase of a regularly $2.29 Marjoram or $4.29 Krakow Nights for just $1 qualifies you for your free Salt &amp; Pepper box. Check out our Marjoram here: https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/marjoram/…/p-728/pd-s  And the tasty Krakow Nights here: https://www.penzeys.com/online-c…/krakow-nights/…/p-618/pd-s If there is some silver lining to all this, it is the very real reminder that America honestly does matter. Why else would Russia go to such lengths or take such risks? I know it’s always trendy to push the idea that America does more harm than good, but that simply isn’t the truth. Our Spice business takes us to the far corners of the globe where we’ve seen first-hand the way America has been able to expand the free world and diminish the power of dictators. For billions of people, America matters. Our president was put in office in part to send the world the message that America can’t be trusted. We must show the world that simply isn’t true. To get your coupon to use in any of our stores Saturday for your free-with-any-purchase $22.95 Salt &amp; Pepper Time gift box please click this link: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also put you on our Voice Of Cooking email list that you can opt out of at any time, but don’t because our emailing list is the place to be. Trust me, it’s not like other email lists. We try hard to be good. If you enjoy being on our Voice Of Cooking email list, mentioning why in the comments below would be most helpful.  No coupon or codes are needed in the stores or online for the regularly $2.29 Marjoram or $4.29 Krakow Nights for just $1 each. These two are automatic for everyone.   Online at penzeys.com, for your free $22.95 Salt &amp; Pepper Time box, after any spending at all, simply enter “Crook” into the apply code box at checkout. It’s easy and there’s no need to place the box in your cart, the Crook code will do that for you automatically and for free. Additional boxes are available for just $5 each, a price we hope to be able to honor through Sunday, April 7. I like the idea of a “Salt &amp; Pepper week at Penzeys” because this reminder of what the president is needs repeating. But this is a while-supplies-last offer and, though we are well stocked, these offers have a habit of taking off on us. In other words, act now! In our stores, with the coupon linked to above, Saturday you really can get this $22.95 box free with just a $1 purchase. Online there is still shipping and handling to deal with. To try and help, this weekend we’ve reduced our usually $40 spending minimum for free shipping to just $25.  And please start talking up the 11.3.20 election now, and any election before then, too. (Tuesday here in Wisconsin we have a Supreme Court race where a Scott “Fox Conn” Walker-appointed judge is up against someone Walker didn’t appoint. Please Vote Your Heart.) I’m guessing, should the real Mueller report ever get released in full, impeachment will very much be back on the table, but we can’t count on that. The obstruction has now spread to the Attorney General and the entire Republican Party. I fear we can no longer count on them to do the right thing. Please share your extra I will Vote 11.3.20 Heart stickers, ideally with those you know that don’t usually vote. Your encouragement means everything. Cooking is a very cool thing. Taking time to care for those around you honestly does set better futures in motion. If cooking has yet to click for you, you need this box. Cooks know what happily ever after is really like. Yes, it’s exhausting, but it’s also flat-out wonderful. This box really is a giant leap for cooking kindness. Get yours now.  If you are already a Cook, never doubt your ability to encourage others. You are admired. Your voice counts. Please use your voice to encourage others to make a positive difference in America and the world come 11.3.20.  Thanks for your support, which keeps us in business even though we say things like: Crook-Crooked-Crookedly-Crook 🙂 Bill bill@penzeys.com p.s. Please help us. Our belief that cooking is what happens when you care about people puts our posts into the political category. You can help offset the extra barriers this brings with it by liking and sharing this post, but equally important are your comments. It’s time for us to be honest about what our president truly is. Please help spread the word. This matters.\n",

      "Free $22.95 Salt &amp; Pepper Time Box w $1 purchase—Mueller Report Not a Nothing Burger Recipe! — It’s Salt &amp; Pepper time, time to admit what’s clearly on the table before us. In the wake of the Mueller report (even the doctored 4-page Attorney General spin version), the reality we must face going is that our president is a Crook. And the problem for America is that he’s not just a run-of-the-mill crook, but instead one quite skilled at directing others to commit his crimes whil...e pretending his innocence.   The research says people with cooking in their lives go on to better futures, but the research so far doesn’t quite know why. My thought is that a life surrounded with the goodness that is cooking leaves us better able to see paths that lead towards positive outcomes while avoiding the negative ones. In many ways our time around the dinner table leaves us better able to tell right from wrong. Yes, as Lincoln said, we can all be fooled some of the time, but Cooks, time and again, lead the way into the can’t be fooled all the time category. Take a Cook’s-eye look at the president’s actual words to the Russians about his opponent’s emails at a point where his campaign already had multiple contacts with the Russians expressing their desire to help make his election a reality. Does he actually say I’m entering into an agreement to commit election interference? No, he is too skilled for that, but it is those very skills that betrays his true nature. What should we make of his actions? As the Voice Of Cooking, let us be the first to say: Crook-Crooked-Crookedly-Crook.  Please sign up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking email list here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html And now that Crook-Crooked-Crookedly-Crook has been said, it’s time to get on to redoubling our efforts to make sure every possible American turns out to vote 11.3.20. As we’ve learned before, a good message travels far, but a good message tied to a really good free offer knows no limits. So through Saturday at midnight, $22.95 Salt &amp; Pepper Time gift boxes free with any purchase. These boxes contain full half-cup-sized jars of our tasty Seasoned Salt and World’s Best Penzeys Pepper. And of course for each jar of Penzeys Pepper sold or given in an offer like this another is given to those who work to feed those in need.  In addition to the two half-cup jars, the Salt &amp; Pepper Time contains our new Embrace Hope refrigerator/bumper magnet, tip cards, Victory pin and three I Will Vote 11.3.20 Heart stickers—one to keep two to share. This really is a $22.95 value free with any purchase.

      "Free $22.95 Salt &amp; Pepper Time Box w $1 purchase—Mueller Report Not a Nothing Burger Recipe! — It’s Salt &amp; Pepper time, time to admit what’s clearly on the table before us. In the wake of the Mueller report (even the doctored 4-page Attorney General spin version), the reality we must face going is that our president is a Crook. And the problem for America is that he’s not just a run-of-the-mill crook, but instead one quite skilled at directing others to commit his crimes whil...e pretending his innocence.   The research says people with cooking in their lives go on to better futures, but the research so far doesn’t quite know why. My thought is that a life surrounded with the goodness that is cooking leaves us better able to see paths that lead towards positive outcomes while avoiding the negative ones. In many ways our time around the dinner table leaves us better able to tell right from wrong. Yes, as Lincoln said, we can all be fooled some of the time, but Cooks, time and again, lead the way into the can’t be fooled all the time category. Take a Cook’s-eye look at the president’s actual words to the Russians about his opponent’s emails at a point where his campaign already had multiple contacts with the Russians expressing their desire to help make his election a reality. Does he actually say I’m entering into an agreement to commit election interference? No, he is too skilled for that, but it is those very skills that betrays his true nature. What should we make of his actions? As the Voice Of Cooking, let us be the first to say: Crook-Crooked-Crookedly-Crook.  Please sign up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking email list here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html And now that Crook-Crooked-Crookedly-Crook has been said, it’s time to get on to redoubling our efforts to make sure every possible American turns out to vote 11.3.20. As we’ve learned before, a good message travels far, but a good message tied to a really good free offer knows no limits. So through Saturday at midnight, $22.95 Salt &amp; Pepper Time gift boxes free with any purchase. These boxes contain full half-cup-sized jars of our tasty Seasoned Salt and World’s Best Penzeys Pepper. And of course for each jar of Penzeys Pepper sold or given in an offer like this another is given to those who work to feed those in need.  In addition to the two half-cup jars, the Salt &amp; Pepper Time contains our new Embrace Hope refrigerator/bumper magnet, tip cards, Victory pin and three I Will Vote 11.3.20 Heart stickers—one to keep two to share. This really is a $22.95 value free with any purchase. You can see the Salt &amp; Pepper Time box here: https://www.penzeys.com/…/salt-pepper-tim…/c-24/p-3189/pd-gb And please check out our Mueller Report Something Burger with its No Secrets Sauce so worth sharing. You can find the recipe here: https://www.penzeys.com/…/mueller-something-burger-with-no…/ At a hearty 1/3 of a pound, this is no Nothing Burger by any means. In addition to our Seasoned Salt and Penzeys Pepper, partially inspired by the commenter from our last post, “Flash Gorski,” this recipe calls for a dollop of sour cream seasoned with Marjoram and/or our tasty Krakow Nights Seasoning as a reminder that selling out our allies to please dictators is not a victimless crime. We have both on sale in 1/4-cup jars for just $1 each. And yes, just the purchase of a regularly $2.29 Marjoram or $4.29 Krakow Nights for just $1 qualifies you for your free Salt &amp; Pepper box. Check out our Marjoram here: https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/marjoram/…/p-728/pd-s  And the tasty Krakow Nights here: https://www.penzeys.com/online-c…/krakow-nights/…/p-618/pd-s If there is some silver lining to all this, it is the very real reminder that America honestly does matter. Why else would Russia go to such lengths or take such risks? I know it’s always trendy to push the idea that America does more harm than good, but that simply isn’t the truth. Our Spice business takes us to the far corners of the globe where we’ve seen first-hand the way America has been able to expand the free world and diminish the power of dictators. For billions of people, America matters. Our president was put in office in part to send the world the message that America can’t be trusted. We must show the world that simply isn’t true. To get your coupon to use in any of our stores Saturday for your free-with-any-purchase $22.95 Salt &amp; Pepper Time gift box please click this link: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also put you on our Voice Of Cooking email list that you can opt out of at any time, but don’t because our emailing list is the place to be. Trust me, it’s not like other email lists. We try hard to be good. If you enjoy being on our Voice Of Cooking email list, mentioning why in the comments below would be most helpful.  No coupon or codes are needed in the stores or online for the regularly $2.29 Marjoram or $4.29 Krakow Nights for just $1 each. These two are automatic for everyone.   Online at penzeys.com, for your free $22.95 Salt &amp; Pepper Time box, after any spending at all, simply enter “Crook” into the apply code box at checkout. It’s easy and there’s no need to place the box in your cart, the Crook code will do that for you automatically and for free. Additional boxes are available for just $5 each, a price we hope to be able to honor through Sunday, April 7. I like the idea of a “Salt &amp; Pepper week at Penzeys” because this reminder of what the president is needs repeating. But this is a while-supplies-last offer and, though we are well stocked, these offers have a habit of taking off on us. In other words, act now! In our stores, with the coupon linked to above, Saturday you really can get this $22.95 box free with just a $1 purchase. Online there is still shipping and handling to deal with. To try and help, this weekend we’ve reduced our usually $40 spending minimum for free shipping to just $25.  And please start talking up the 11.3.20 election now, and any election before then, too. (Tuesday here in Wisconsin we have a Supreme Court race where a Scott “Fox Conn” Walker-appointed judge is up against someone Walker didn’t appoint. Please Vote Your Heart.) I’m guessing, should the real Mueller report ever get released in full, impeachment will very much be back on the table, but we can’t count on that. The obstruction has now spread to the Attorney General and the entire Republican Party. I fear we can no longer count on them to do the right thing. Please share your extra I will Vote 11.3.20 Heart stickers, ideally with those you know that don’t usually vote. Your encouragement means everything. Cooking is a very cool thing. Taking time to care for those around you honestly does set better futures in motion. If cooking has yet to click for you, you need this box. Cooks know what happily ever after is really like. Yes, it’s exhausting, but it’s also flat-out wonderful. This box really is a giant leap for cooking kindness. Get yours now.  If you are already a Cook, never doubt your ability to encourage others. You are admired. Your voice counts. Please use your voice to encourage others to make a positive difference in America and the world come 11.3.20.  Thanks for your support, which keeps us in business even though we say things like: Crook-Crooked-Crookedly-Crook 🙂 Bill bill@penzeys.com p.s. Please help us. Our belief that cooking is what happens when you care about people puts our posts into the political category. You can help offset the extra barriers this brings with it by liking and sharing this post, but equally important are your comments. It’s time for us to be honest about what our president truly is. Please help spread the word. This matters.\n",

Check out our Marjoram here: https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/marjoram/…/p-728/pd-s  And the tasty Krakow Nights here: https://www.penzeys.com/online-c…/krakow-nights/…/p-618/pd-s If there is some silver lining to all this, it is the very real reminder that America honestly does matter. Why else would Russia go to such lengths or take such risks? I know it’s always trendy to push the idea that America does more harm than good, but that simply isn’t the truth. Our Spice business takes us to the far corners of the globe where we’ve seen first-hand the way America has been able to expand the free world and diminish the power of dictators. For billions of people, America matters. Our president was put in office in part to send the world the message that America can’t be trusted. We must show the world that simply isn’t true. To get your coupon to use in any of our stores Saturday for your free-with-any-purchase $22.95 Salt &amp; Pepper Time gift box please click this link: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html This will also put you on our Voice Of Cooking email list that you can opt out of at any time, but don’t because our emailing list is the place to be. Trust me, it’s not like other email lists. We try hard to be good. If you enjoy being on our Voice Of Cooking email list, mentioning why in the comments below would be most helpful.  No coupon or codes are needed in the stores or online for the regularly $2.29 Marjoram or $4.29 Krakow Nights for just $1 each. These two are automatic for everyone.   Online at penzeys.com, for your free $22.95 Salt &amp; Pepper Time box, after any spending at all, simply enter “Crook” into the apply code box at checkout. It’s easy and there’s no need to place the box in your cart, the Crook code will do that for you automatically and for free. Additional boxes are available for just $5 each, a price we hope to be able to honor through Sunday, April 7. I like the idea of a “Salt &amp; Pepper week at Penzeys” because this reminder of what the president is needs repeating. But this is a while-supplies-last offer and, though we are well stocked, these offers have a habit of taking off on us. In other words, act now! In our stores, with the coupon linked to above, Saturday you really can get this $22.95 box free with just a $1 purchase. Online there is still shipping and handling to deal with. To try and help, this weekend we’ve reduced our usually $40 spending minimum for free shipping to just $25.  And please start talking up the 11.3.20 election now, and any election before then, too. (Tuesday here in Wisconsin we have a Supreme Court race where a Scott “Fox Conn” Walker-appointed judge is up against someone Walker didn’t appoint. Please Vote Your Heart.) I’m guessing, should the real Mueller report ever get released in full, impeachment will very much be back on the table, but we can’t count on that. The obstruction has now spread to the Attorney General and the entire Republican Party. I fear we can no longer count on them to do the right thing. Please share your extra I will Vote 11.3.20 Heart stickers, ideally with those you know that don’t usually vote. Your encouragement means everything. Cooking is a very cool thing. Taking time to care for those around you honestly does set better futures in motion. If cooking has yet to click for you, you need this box. Cooks know what happily ever after is really like. Yes, it’s exhausting, but it’s also flat-out wonderful. This box really is a giant leap for cooking kindness. Get yours now.  If you are already a Cook, never doubt your ability to encourage others. You are admired. Your voice counts. Please use your voice to encourage others to make a positive difference in America and the world come 11.3.20.  Thanks for your support, which keeps us in business even though we say things like: Crook-Crooked-Crookedly-Crook 🙂 Bill bill@penzeys.com p.s. Please help us. Our belief that cooking is what happens when you care about people puts our posts into the political category. You can help offset the extra barriers this brings with it by liking and sharing this post, but equally important are your comments. It’s time for us to be honest about what our president truly is. Please help spread the word. This matters.\n",

      "Free $22.95 Salt &amp; Pepper Time Box w $1 purchase—Mueller Report Not a Nothing Burger Recipe! — It’s Salt &amp; Pepper time, time to admit what’s clearly on the table before us. In the wake of the Mueller report (even the doctored 4-page Attorney General spin version), the reality we must face going is that our president is a Crook. And the problem for America is that he’s not just a run-of-the-mill crook, but instead one quite skilled at directing others to commit his crimes whil...e pretending his innocence.   The research says people with cooking in their lives go on to better futures, but the research so far doesn’t quite know why. My thought is that a life surrounded with the goodness that is cooking leaves us better able to see paths that lead towards positive outcomes while avoiding the negative ones. In many ways our time around the dinner table leaves us better able to tell right from wrong. Yes, as Lincoln said, we can all be fooled some of the time, but Cooks, time and again, lead the way into the can’t be fooled all the time category. Take a Cook’s-eye look at the president’s actual words to the Russians about his opponent’s emails at a point where his campaign already had multiple contacts with the Russians expressing their desire to help make his election a reality. Does he actually say I’m entering into an agreement to commit election interference? No, he is too skilled for that, but it is those very skills that betrays his true nature. What should we make of his actions? As the Voice Of Cooking, let us be the first to say: Crook-Crooked-Crookedly-Crook.  Please sign up for our Penzeys Voice Of Cooking email list here: http://spices.penzeys.com/voice.html And now that Crook-Crooked-Crookedly-Crook has been said, it’s time to get on to redoubling our efforts to make sure every possible American turns out to vote 11.3.20. As we’ve learned before, a good message travels far, but a good message tied to a really good free offer knows no limits. So through Saturday at midnight, $22.95 Salt &amp; Pepper Time gift boxes free with any purchase. These boxes contain full half-cup-sized jars of our tasty Seasoned Salt and World’s Best Penzeys Pepper. And of course for each jar of Penzeys Pepper sold or given in an offer like this another is given to those who work to feed those in need.  In addition to the two half-cup jars, the Salt &amp; Pepper Time contains our new Embrace Hope refrigerator/bumper magnet, tip cards, Victory pin and three I Will Vote 11.3.20 Heart stickers—one to keep two to share. This really is a $22.95 value free with any purchase. You can see the Salt &amp; Pepper Time box here: https://www.penzeys.com/…/salt-pepper-tim…/c-24/p-3189/pd-gb And please check out our Mueller Report Something Burger with its No Secrets Sauce so worth sharing. You can find the recipe here: https://www.penzeys.com/…/mueller-something-burger-with-no…/ At a hearty 1/3 of a pound, this is no Nothing Burger by any means.

      "This is a disclaimer that this ad is by Tariq Albazzaz, administrator of this page. Immigration Dilemma: Torn Families, The Wall, and “No Illegal Human”       “Racist” and “bigot” is definitely thrown around a lot today.  Videos of white nationalists or crimes against minorities are shown in the news and on social media frequently.  News reports of children torn from parents have been catching headlines.  People talk about how ridiculous the idea of a border wall is, and some... are suggesting that “no human being is illegal”, i.e. anyone should be able to come and have the opportunity to live in America and enjoy it as any citizen would.  Suggesting migration controls tends to bring up the words starting this article, and one underlying theme seems to be that the current President has caused undercover racism to come out into the open, and even created racism among people where there once was little to none.  After all, it’s suggested that the United States has always welcomed immigrants.  In a White House Press Briefing, the CNN reporter Jim Acosta spoke about the Statue of Liberty and how inscribed on it are the words “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free…”.  It definitely sounds inspiring.  So let’s take a look at the immigration policies of the United States in the past, how governments debate, create, and enforce immigration laws, and a generally more detailed picture of what is being discussed.       Go to New York and you can see people of all colors, with many different languages being spoken.  I remember as a child being taught in a school textbook that New York was considered the “melting pot” of the US.  We learned about how immigrants came to Ellis Island from Europe and contributed to the country that we know today.  What wasn’t in the textbook was the fact that immigration policy at the time was actually much less open and was much more strict than today, explicitly excluding many Asian immigrants, while being more open to those viewed as more similar in culture and skin tone - the Europeans.  If you really think about it, this shouldn’t be very surprising.  If American society discriminated (and discriminates today) against those of African descent, why not others?  In fact, even those white Europeans faced discrimination, and there were calls for more controls on immigration to the US as more immigrants came.  In 1921, the Emergency Quota Act was put into law, which explicitly restricted the annual number of immigrants from any one country to 3% of the total from that country counted in the US Census of 1910.  Then, in 1924, a stricter law was enacted lowering that 3% to 2%, and only allowing that percentage from the lower number in the U.S. Census of 1890.  That doesn’t sound like we were so willing to take in all those “huddled masses” as Jim Acosta said.  Obviously this has come up before, and nothing seriously suggested today by the White House or Congress comes close to explicitly restricting immigration as was done during the time we had started to supposedly become such a “melting pot” and bastien of open borders and people of many colors and cultures.       Beyond those schoolbook lies, the reality of immigration and how countries control flows of people became more apparent to me over the years.  I remember hearing of illegal immigrants working in the crop fields of my small hometown in Georgia when I was still in elementary school.  At the time, I had just moved to rural Georgia from the Washington D.C. area where I had spent the prior years.  I have visual memories of seeing Hispanic workers in the hot, sun-baked fields picking cabbage and other crops, and of them coming in old school-buses to the local Wal-Mart shopping supercenter to buy groceries and other necessities.  One day, I remember they formed a line in the parking lot, and at the front of the line was a towel laid on the pavement with loaves of bread and packs of what looked like bologna.  A couple people put the sandwiches together, handed them to the person at the front of the line, and the next person came forward to get their sandwich.  Their clothes were tattered, and I don’t remember hearing them speak English.  It was common knowledge that they worked very hard and accepted low wages for that pay.  For farmers and contractors, it was a win-win: more labor for less money.  When I worked at a beef manufacturing plant when I was 18, the next station on the factory line was all staffed by Mexican immigrants.  They couldn’t speak English, but we became good friends, joked, and helped each other make the day go by faster.  I even learned a little Spanish (mostly bad words).  My hometown in Georgia also had immigrants from India who owned many or most of the gas stations in the town.  After moving to NY several years later, I began to be exposed to more immigrants, now from all over the world.  My own father came from Baghdad, Iraq in 1973 to the United States.  But it was when I moved to Japan that I became much more directly aware and involved with immigration.  Before then, I didn’t know much about what a “visa” was, but now I knew that a visa was a temporary permit for residency given to you by the country as an immigrant.  I remembered Asian friends in NY telling me about their difficulties in getting visas for work in the US.  Now that I had to get a visa myself, I learned a visa would dictate what you had been granted temporary residency for: work, school, marriage to a citizen, etc.  It also stated the period of time the permit was valid - for a period of months, years, or indefinitely.  Now it was clear to me that nations controlled who came and went into their country: you are told what you are allowed to do under that arrangement, such as work in specific jobs, and how long you are allowed to stay.  In parliaments across Europe, in Congress in the US, worldwide: this is something that is discussed and debated among all political parties, with clear rules and limits put into place.       In fact, this comes full circle to a fact the news almost always fails to ensure the public is reminded: we have immigration controls, and so do all other nations.  You cannot simply go to another country and decide you will now live there; in fact, in many, you cannot even visit without applying directly to the immigration bureau of that country.  It is a crucial role of a government to control its borders and the flow of people through it.  Imagine if the US simply let anyone into the country; the policy would be “if you can get here, you can stay and work and would be granted all the rights of domestic citizens”.  People would flood into the country from other nations, probably mostly poorer nations, because they would want to take the opportunity to show that they can work hard and are hungry to make a better life for themselves.  Housing costs would likely go up, wages would likely go down - it would probably not work very well for the prior domestic residents.  If you’ve stayed up late at night, you’ve probably seen the commercials where “for only a penny a day”, you can sponsor a poor child in a poor country.  This is a sad reality - it’s been said that half of the world’s population lives on less than $2.50 per day.  The amount of struggling poor around the globe is much, much larger than the number of people in the US.  The idea of a union of countries with blanket access and free movement of people to live and work is something that has been done.  Right now, the European Union is comprised of 26 countries with this free movement policy called the “Schengen Area”.  One key distinction must be made: these 26 are not the most impoverished nations in the world, so the free movement of people from, for example, sub-Saharan Africa does not come under the terms of this agreement.  However, the EU has allowed many refugees from Syria or Africa to settle in the region.  This has created huge debate and controversy, with political parties promoting less immigration garnering more support and winning elections.  In Hungary and Slovenia, this has become a reality against the will of the governing body of the EU.  Those nations have installed border fences and walls to prevent those from coming into their countries.  Spain has also done the same.  Italy has had immigration at the forefront of its recent elections.  Apparently the notion of a border barrier, such as a wall, is not out of the ordinary.  One big event came in 2016 which is very similar and related to the immigration debate put forth in Donald Trump’s campaign.  In June of that year, the citizens of the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU.  Many analysts and research suggested the single, largest issue for citizens and the vote out was the policy of open borders to anyone from this immigration union of 26 nations.   Clearly the issue of immigration is not confined to the United States - this has become a global issue.       In spite of the fact that construction at the border is going on around the world, the idea that the government construct a wall on our border is portrayed as ridiculous by many news organizations.  The UK’s vote to leave the EU seemed to stem from legal immigration; however, in the US, illegal immigration tends to get much more media attention.  So how do immigrants become “illegal” in the US?  The two most prevalent ways are crossing the border without going through a checkpoint (such as in the desert or through a tunnel), or being issued a visa granted for a set period but then staying inside the country beyond that allowed period (going from legal resident to illegal resident).  In 2017, there were approximately 304,000 border arrests from people doing this. The number of people successful is less clear and is estimated to be anywhere from 75,000 to 750,000.  Another way people gain access is by claiming asylum, although the numbers of people doing so is far less.  To attain refugee status after claiming asylum, an individual must prove they fit the following criteria: “an individual must have suffered persecution or fear suffering persecution because of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group”.  What is often left out is the attitude towards immigrants and asylees in Mexico.  Mexico deports many who try to enter their own borders.  A report this year from Amnesty International found that 75% of immigrants were not informed of their right to seek asylum, even though it is required by Mexican law.  The country also deported more immigrants per capita than the United States.  Only 1% of Mexico’s population is foreign, whereas the US’s number is around 15%.  It’s even stated in Mexican law that the country may deny entry to anyone in order to maintain its “demographic balance”.  Mexico also much more easily grants visas to those from wealthier countries.  At the same time, the government has published literature in the past advising illegal immigrants in the United States on how to avoid US immigration officials.  For a country that chastises the administration for the idea of a border wall, this all sounds hypocritical.  There is also the issue of children being held in detention centers in the US.  The news media makes it seem as if this began since the election; however, this has been publicized and ongoing under past administrations, such as the Obama administration, under which the record number of deportations occurred.  Additionally, the government tries to release most children to sponsors, such as family.  While this is definitely something the government should address, framing seems to be more popular than discussing realities.       The facts on immigration never seem to be laid bare in mainstream news articles.  If this has been ongoing with child detainees, why hasn’t this been addressed before?  What should the government do to more fairly accommodate those detained who illegally reside in the US, while also deterring illegal immigration?  Discussions shouldn’t always include racist remarks of “drug dealers” or “rapists” - many simply want to live a better life.  However, it also shouldn’t include “racist” or “bigot” for suggesting that a line be drawn - there has always been a line drawn for all countries.\n",

      "Platform - This is evolving constantly via input from residents and local activists! Additionally, everything that currently is on here already can be paid for, excluding taxes, degree requirements, and technically excluding wage increases. I think by July or August, I will release what I consider the People's Budget, using the proposed Fiscal 2021 budget  totals(operating and capital). POLICING Requiring police to have Bachelor's degree in Sociology or Criminal Justice by 2025 - New recruits to have this requirement starting in 2023 More frequent community policing and violence prevention events A minimum 30% cut to policing budget for Fiscal 2022-2025 (More could be reallocated to enrolling officers into college programs above) Living in the city to be required of officers by 2023 More training on how to treat survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, as well as residents with mental illnesses That 30% would be reallocated to... Poverty Erasure and Community Enhancement (PEACE) Zones Each year, $150 million, previously in the police budget, will be split into six $25 million direct investments into economically-challenged and environmentally-challenged communities - 24 communities over four years. That means **$600 million** in direct investments over a four-year term. Each community will receive an additional $1 million in the following year (see below). Breakdown $9 million in RFPs and matching grants for home renovation, deconstruction, and construction of homes - Goal of 100 new/revitalized homes in each community (Avg.$90,000 toward each home) All homes must have reflective roofing or green roofing Homes offered to residents at 30-60% AMI, with priority given to residents in community $1 million in subsidies (up to $800/mo) for rent (or mortgage) and utilities ($400/mo) (for each of the first two years of a lease) --15% of homes must have ADA-compliant exteriors and interiors, specifically, bathrooms $3 million in small business grants (including matching grants) $3 million into complete streets $1.5 million for a co-op grocery store $3 million toward a community center $2.5 million in permeable sidewalks/surfaces $2 million for a mental health facility  First Six Communities: 1. Sandtown-Winchester/Harlem Park - $25 million into 249 acres 2. Baybrook - $25 million into 2.37 sq. miles 3. Cedonia - $25 million into 1.46 sq. miles 4. Broadway East/Berea - $25 million into 312 acres 5. Westport/Mt. Winans/Lakeland/Cherry Hill - $25 million into 2.37 sq. miles 6. Park Heights/Park Circle - $25 million into .86 sq. miles ***The $1 million in rent and utility subsidies is akin to the Federal Housing Administration's federally-backed loans for white Americans, beginning in the 1930s, to increase homeownership. Unfortunately, this was not accessible to black Americans. This arrangement permits private homebuilders a boost to their business, and owners are assured on-time payments to help in their profit-making.*** Further, these investments will attract additional investments from private sources, potentially doubling the overall amount of money funneled into the community. Ideally, from a housing perspective, we'd see a matched $9 million to build homes for people in the 70%-90% AMI range - creating desperately-needed, mixed-income neighborhoods ECONOMY Living Wage Policy - $18/hr by 2025 January 2022 - $14.50 January 2023 - $16.00 January 2024 - $17.50 January 2025 - $18.00 ***Business owners often assert that they are unable to raise wages this significantly for their workers, and will have to pass it on to their patrons. THIS ALREADY HAPPENS! Jobs dependent on tips, for example, are the first subsidy patrons provide, and the second is government assistance (SNAP, EITC, TANF, Medicaid) to make ends meet. 52% of workers in the country utilize at least one of those programs. A living wage erases a double-subsidy.*** City will follow suit Public-private partnership to revive Old Town Mall as a co-op grocery store Reasonable tax incentives for green businesses that relocate/expand to Baltimore (No giving something like a first born child a la Amazon!) - solar and wind companies, energy efficiency companies, sustainable materials companies, and the like Build a just economy that no longer depends on chemical or fossil fuel production to clean Baltimore's air as much as possible (~10-year vision) TRANSIT Fire Sale for Transit (FiST) Program - Selling off all Baltimore-owned properties (~17,000) for $5,000-$50,000 each to nonprofits, benefit corporations, and small businesses that are not air or water polluters --If all sites were sold at the high end, Baltimore would raise $850 million toward the Red Line --Mayor and councilperson of that area will sign a letter of support to increase likelihood of nonprofits garnering funding to acquire the land Establish a process to allocate $5 million toward BaltimoreLink system annually Expanding Charm City Circulator to Cherry Hill/Westport/Curtis Bay Car-commuter transit study Complete Streets: Introduce Congestion Pricing by 2023 to assist in funding enhanced mass transit Enhancing bus only and bike lanes, with fines up to $300 if vehicle is not turning Lowering rates for city-owned garages Permitting overnight usage Assess feasibility of staggered start times for businesses to ease congestion further Assess options for improving Light Rail system, including new cars, by 2025  Allocating funds to place all streetlights in the downtown grid, and one half-mile in each direction, to 60-second cycles.

      "Why did I reduce the PFD in 2016?   Before you make up your mind on the decisions about the budget and the fiscal plan, please take three minutes to watch this video.  The decision to reduce the PFD in 2016 in response to Alaska’s fiscal crisis will be one of the defining issues of this election. Our opponents on both the left and the right have criticized this decision. Some Alaskans believe that it was a terrible decision that we never should have considered -- that this de...cision was unnecessary, that if we had cut more out of state government, we could have avoided making any changes to the way we manage the Permanent Fund. Other Alaskans believe that restructuring the Permanent Fund was an essential step to creating a long term fiscal plan and to making sure that the Permanent Fund and the Dividend could continue to grow for future generations. One of the main reasons I ran four years ago was because Alaska was running a large deficit ($1.6 billion) and nobody was talking about it.  This gap between our spending and what we were bringing in could have been addressed by budget cuts alone, without a PFD reduction or any new revenue… However, days after we were elected, the price of oil collapsed to $26/barrell, reducing state revenues by more than eighty percent. Alaska went from having the largest savings account in the country to the largest budget deficit of any state in the country ($3.7 billion)... overnight.  In our first year, before we looked at any changes to the Fund, we went to work to reduce the state budget. We did not want to propose changes before we had cut everything we felt we could. That meant closing over 40 state facilities. It meant a loss of 77 positions at the Department of Public Safety alone (and that was the Department with one of the smallest reductions). It meant reducing the state spending by 44%, or $1.7 billion, from 2013. Ultimately, we reduced the budget down to 2007 levels, with state employment at its lowest level in fifteen years. Additional cuts would mean hurting our schools. Additional cuts would mean cutting the people that keep our roads and airports running. Additional cuts would mean cutting our ability to fund troopers, prosecutors, and our response to the opioid epidemic. Additional cuts would mean cutting the things that keep businesses and workers invested in Alaska. Additional cuts would mean eliminating our state share of Federal grants that match our share up to ten times over. We will continue to look for ways to reduce the budget and spend our money smarter. But we are literally at the point where large additional cuts could cost us more money then they would save.   That's why, while you see both of our opponents advocating for \"additional cuts\", you won't see them specify where those cuts should go. Alaskans knew that we could not cut our way out of the fiscal crisis we were in. The alternative was either make some changes, or just completely spend down our savings. And that's what the Legislature chose to do. Rather than risk the political cost of change, the Legislature spent down $14 billion in savings. That's fourteen billion that we will never have back to invest in our schools, infrastructure, and public safety. We were behaving like a guy who loses his job and decides to spend down all his family's savings before looking for a new job. We were about to lose the house... At the rate the Legislature was spending down our savings, and I believed that the Permanent Fund itself was at risk. Once we spent our savings, the only thing left to meet our debts would be the Permanent Fund earnings account, from which the dividend itself  is paid out each year. . That put the Dividend at risk of going away. Forever. I reduced the PFD in 2016 because the Legislature had made it clear that they were not willing to be the first to take any action that would result in less money going out to Alaskans. I had Legislators tell me privately: \"We're going to make you do what we should be doing.\" I reduced the PFD in 2016 in order to leave that money in the Fund, so that it could continue to earn interest and grow the Fund, strengthening Alaska's greatest asset. Every dollar that I vetoed from the PFD stayed in the Fund. I reduced the PFD in 2016 so that the Legislature would find the courage to pass a fiscal plan compromise. That compromise has provided the stability that businesses need to invest in Alaska. It has reduced our budget deficit by 80%. It has allowed us to forward fund education rather than pink slipping our teachers at the end of every school year. It has allowed us to bring on badly needed prosecutors and troopers in the fight against opioids. Ultimately, I believe that the decision to restructure the Permanent Fund will allow both the Permanent Fund and the Dividend to grow long-term. That's what we saw this year, with the PFD increasing to $1,600, well above the historic average. The decision to reduce the PFD was the hardest decision I've ever made. It impacted many Alaskans, no question about it. Byron and I believed that the alternative would hurt much worse, by endangering the future of the Permanent Fund and the Dividend long term. I didn't make my decision because it was \"politically correct.\" My job as Governor isn't to be politically correct. My job is to put Alaska on the strongest path possible for the future. If you have questions, let us know and we'll try to answer them. If this video and this information was helpful to you, please share to your Facebook page so other Alaskans can consider it as well. Thank you for taking the time. I can't promise that you will always like the decisions I make as your Governor. But I can promise you that I will always tell you the truth and that I will always put Alaska's future first.  - Bill Walker\n",

      "“One of the suggestions you hear, particularly in cities like San Francisco or Seattle, where rents and prices are also ridiculously high, is that cities need more housing. It's an appeal to the most basic of economic principles: supply and demand. Add more supply and demand, in the form of competition for available units, will lessen and prices drop in response...Only, that concept relies on the most elementary and simplistic of teachings from economics, which, as anything i...n engineering or science, must radically simplify constraints and conditions to address any question.  \"Too much complexity prevents manageable solutions. “A Federal Reserve published report from earlier this year looks at the notion of marginal additions to housing and finds that they're unlikely to help. Prices will march on as they have. “Researchers at the Fed found there were no ‘direct estimates of the rent elasticity with respect to new housing supply in the literature.’ No one knows how much housing you'd have to add to have any significant impact on costs. So, the researchers built a simulation to estimate, directly from data, the elasticity of rent with respect to housing supply. “They wanted to know how much rents might change if there was an influx of new housing. Given metropolitan housing crises and a lack of other data, it was an important study. “However, elasticity isn't a simple phenomenon. There are products where changing the price doesn't necessarily result in big shifts of demand. Look at the Apple iPhone X: $1,000 for the device and tens of millions purchased it. “The Fed report suggests that housing will be much the same: ‘The implication of this finding is that even if a city were able to ease some supply constraints to achieve a marginal increase in its housing stock, the city will not experience a meaningful reduction in rental burdens.’ “Add 5% more housing to the most expensive neighborhoods and the rents would drop only by 0.5%. “The reason is that people like the amenities in given neighborhoods and want to live there, so will continue to pay higher prices. Amenities can include shopping, schools, and ease of access to public transportation. “The researchers thought there might be a workable alternative to increasing the housing stock, which would be improving the amenities in other neighborhoods: “For example, improving access to and the quality of public transportation in neighborhoods far from the city core could make these neighborhoods more competitive with more expensive, downtown neighborhoods and so could relieve some price pressure in downtown neighborhoods through a substitution effect. “Maybe. But that seems more a solution for those at the top of the food chain, as they'd be the ones in the most expensive neighborhoods. “Some applied logic suggests that should other neighborhoods get an upgrade and the substitution effect work, PEOPLE WITH MORE MONEY WOULD OUTBID THOSE WHO ARE IN LESS EXPENSIVE NEIGHBORHOODS IN A CASCADING GENTRIFICATION ENGINE. It doesn't take a lot of imagination to see this as pushing more moderate- to lower-income people out, unless there was a big push to reserve housing for them.

      "URGENT. PLEASE SIGN PETITION Save the 650 Greyhounds That Could Be Killed in Macau We have got until July to save the lives of hundreds of greyhounds in China. For many animal lovers, news that Macau Canidrome was closing down was more than welcome.  The infamous Macau Canidrome is known as the place where greyhounds are shipped to race, waste away and ultimately die. In fact, according to one study, in just one year alone, 383 dogs were put down at the Macau race track.  If that was the death toll when the racetrack was running, it's no wonder why animal activists are worried about the 650 greyhounds that currently call the canidrome home.  They believe that before ,or by, the time the track shuts its doors all or most of the dogs could be killed — a virtual dog slaughter. All because the track has no more use for them.  Now they are asking the Macau government to step in and force the racetrack to hand the dogs over to a local animal rescue organization so they can be adopted out to loving families.  Add your name to the call to save the Macau 650. Tell the Macau government you want the dogs to be handed over to the local animal shelter.\n",
